MR. GRENVILLE TO THE KING
Tuesday, March 5, 1765
I humbly beg leave to express part of the joy which I feel at the happy account of your Majesty's being so much better.
I would not, however, presume at this time to trouble your Majesty with any business if the enclosed letter from the Duke and Duchess of Athol, to the Treasury, relative to the Isle of Man, did not make it necessary for me to receive your Majesty's directions to lay it before the House of Commons, in order to their proceeding upon it. By the mark of your Royal munificence referred to in the end of that letter is meant a grant of �2000 a-year to the Duke and Duchess of Athol for their respective lives, out of the Revenues of Ireland, which, from the great diminution of their income, by the particular circumstances of their case, as well as from the great benefit to be derived to the Irish Revenues from this purchase, it is hoped your Majesty will not think improper or unreasonable, any more than the other parts of this proposition, the reason of which I will beg leave to explain when your Majesty will allow me to have the honour of waiting upon you.
Lord Strange has entreated me to lay the two enclosed commissions for the Judges to hold the ensuing assizes for the County of Lancaster before your Majesty for your Royal signature, as they require dispatch.
MR. GRENVILLE TO THE KING
Downing Street, March 5, 1765
I laid before the House of Commons the letter from the Duke and Duchess of Athol, which I had the honour of sending to your Majesty this morning for your directions, and after explaining the whole of the proposition contained in it to the House, and informing them that if your Majesty should be pleased to comply with the request at the latter end of it, it would only be in consequence of their wish and approbation of this whole measure for the public service, I had the pleasure to find the House unanimous upon this subject, and am extremely glad that this important business is in so fair a way of being settled to the general satisfaction, and to the great advantage of the revenues both of this kingdom and of Ireland.
The debate in the House of Commons yesterday was opened by Mr. Nicholson Calvert who moved for a Bill for the relief of the subject on informations in the Court of King's Bench, filed by and in the name of the Attorney-General. Mr. Serjeant Hewitt seconded the motion, and both of them admitted that no abuse, at least for many years past, had been made of the power vested by law in the Attorney-General for that purpose, insisting only that it might be an instrument of oppression in bad times, though not used as such at present.
The Attorney-General answered these gentlemen, and gave a very full and satisfactory account of the antiquity and legality of this power. He urged that the Attorney-General was a sworn officer, and therefore bound to execute this part of his office to the best of his judgment, for which he was answerable both to his conscience, and to the law, like other judicial officers.
That he had the satisfaction to know that he had never filed an information upon which the party had not afterwards been convicted, and that therefore, though for his own part he could wish to be freed from the exercise of a power which brought much odium and no pleasure, yet he could not consent to strip the Crown of its just prerogative in an instance in which it was not even pretended it had been abused.
In support of the motion spoke almost every gentleman who usually speaks with the opposition in Parliament, Mr. G. Onslow, Mr. T. Townshend, Mr. Rose Fuller, Sir William Meredith, Sir G. Savile, Mr. Beckford, Sir William Baker, Lord G. Cavendish, Lord John Cavendish, Mr. J. Grenville, and Lord Palmerston. Against the question spoke almost every gentleman of the law in the House. Mr. Yorke very fully and very ably, Mr. Morton, Mr. Forrester, Mr. Wilbraham, and Mr. Wedderburn, all of whom showed the impropriety of the question in so strong a light that it was much doubted whether those who moved it would have ventured to divide the House upon it. Lord Frederick Campbell likewise spoke against the question very well, and concluded with saying that he rejoiced to find that we lived at a time when, instead of real grievances, the apprehension of grievances was all that the most disposed to find fault could complain of.
Mr. Yorke took particular notice of the many libels which had been published, and of the lenity of the Government with regard to them. He observed what strange doctrines of law had been propagated, and
amongst others, that of the jury being judges of the law as well as the fact, which would deprive the subject of the benefit of moving in arrest of judgment, and of having the opinion of the Judges in point of law, as well as of the jury in matter of fact, before he could be condemned.
The other gentlemen of the law spoke very well, and Mr. Wilbraham with great weight from his character, knowledge, and long experience. 
Mr. Fazakerley likewise attended to the last, and intended to have spoken on the same side, but found himself unable from his great age to go through with the fatigue.
Mr. Hussey did not speak, but voted with the majority, as did Mr. Charles Townshend (Lord Townshend's brother) and many others who have not constantly voted on that side.
Mr. Fuller having mentioned M. D'Eon's case as one of those in which an information had been filed, many gentlemen took notice of the propriety of it. Mr. Yorke represented the necessity of it in the strongest and most convincing terms, and expressed his firm belief of the injustice and outrage committed against M. de Guerchy. Upon the whole, the gentlemen of the law, who spoke against the question, treated it so very fully, and with so much approbation, that there was not any room, nor indeed the least occasion, for any one else to speak upon it.
The arguments used in support of the question turned principally upon the danger and possibility of the abuse of this power, although it had not lately been abused. It was said that there was no occasion for it, as the grand jury might be applied to in the regular course of proceedings, or the Court of King's Bench, for leave to file it, as is done in other cases.
The great increase of the power of the Crown was urged from the increase of the public debt, and with regard to libels, that there had been libels on both sides, and that they ought to be equally punished; and lastly it was insisted, that even supposing that informations of this sort ought not to be taken away, yet the Bill should be received to regulate them in whatever instances it might be proper. The House sat 'till between 7 and 8 o'clock, and the Division was 207 against the question, and 78 for it. I ought to beg
pardon for this long account, if it were not given in obedience to your Majesty's command, which I obey with the utmost joy, as I flatter myself that it is a fresh proof of your Majesty's health continuing to mend, for the perfect re-establishment of which I offer my most ardent vows and prayers.
Agreeably to your Majesty's orders, I enclose with this such warrants of form as are ready for your Royal
Signature.
MR. GRENVILLE TO THE EARL OP HALIFAX
April 10, 1765. My dear Lord, � The messenger brought me the honour of your Lordship's letter this morning, together with Lord Mansfield's to you, which I return inclosed with this. I understand that it was settled by the Minute taken at our meeting on Friday last, that there is to be no variation from the former Act, except in the power to be reserved to His Majesty, to appoint the Queen, or any other person of the Royal family, to be the Regent during the minority of the successor, and that the Speech from the throne is to contain the sense of that Minute precisely, with a proper reference only to the last Regency Act. Lord Sandwich gave me the pleasure of knowing before I left London that this Minute had met with His Majesty's perfect approbation.
I take it for granted, therefore, that the Speech must in substance be drawn exactly conformable to it, and in that case 1 do not see how the draft of the Speech can be necessary to give the proper directions for preparing the Bill agreeable to the Minute. I have always felt that there would be some delicacy and difficulty in stating this matter with precision and distinctness in a Speech from the throne, and for that reason desired if possible to have had the words of the Speech settled at the same meeting, but as that was declined, I should be extremely glad to receive your Lordship's and Lord Mansfield's ideas upon this subject before I put anything upon paper; especially if there is the least intention of making any other variations from the last Act, which I was so far from thinking of doing in the draft of the Speech to be prepared here, that I have not even brought down the Act with me into the country; if therefore anything of that kind shall be found necessary, the Speech must be altered agreeably to such farther alterations as shall be made in the Act if they are any way material.
I explained to your Lordship my general idea upon this subject, and did not intend to reduce it into writing till my return to town about the middle of next week, when, as Lord Mansfield rightly observes, we shall be all in town, and may talk it over together.
You will see from what I have said how impossible it is for me to send you at present the sketch of the Speech as you desire, but I will endeavour to prepare it and bring it to town with me; in the meantime I hope this will be no hindrance to your Lordship, nor put you under any difficulties, the subject being confined to and explained by the Minutes of the Council, upon which alone, both the Speech and Address must be founded.
I am, &c. George Grenville.
I rejoice to hear of M. de Guerchy's promise to pay the money due to us from France in a few days, as it is really of consequence to shew the good faith of that country by their punctuality in making the payments according to Treaty.
MR. GRENVILLE TO THE KING.
Downing Street, April 24, 1765,
The House of Commons have agreed to the Address proposed by the House of Lords to be presented to your Majesty, without any division, but not nemine contra- dicente.
When I moved the concurrence, I opened the general state of the proposition with the proper acknowledgments of your Majesty's goodness and concern for our welfare from which it took its rise, and I observed that the difference between this and the former Act, arose from the difference of circumstances, and from the great length of time for which the present provision was made, compared with that of the 24th of the late King.
Lord North seconded the motion very properly. Mr. Nicholson Calvert said that he did not then object to the Address, but objected to the power of appointing the Regent, and to the constitution of the Council, which he compared to that established by King Henry VIIL, to which he attributed the troubles during the minority of his successor, King Edward VI.
Mr. Beckford spoke next, and carried it still further, for he declared that, with all possible duty and attachment to your Majesty, he should oppose this Act in every step of it, and must oppose the Address as implying a general approbation of it; that he thought there was no occasion for any Regency Bill whatever; that whenever that grievous calamity should befall us, the Parliament would take care of the Government, which they would do much better and more properly than by giving a power to name a Regent and a Council, which he entirely disapproved of.
Mr. Nugent then spoke for the proposition, and showed the propriety of it, and how unseemly it was that the Address should not go without a negative. Mr. G. Onslow (the late Speaker's son) spoke next, and recommended strongly unanimity upon the Address, but laid in his claim to oppose the Bill whenever it should come before the House. He was followed by young Mr. Thos. Townshend, who went upon pretty much the same grounds with Mr. Onslow, but with more eagerness against the provisions of the Bill, which he would suppose to come, not from your Majesty, but from your Ministers. This closed the debate; the question was put, and carried without a divison, but Mr. Beckford and Mr. Calvert gave their negatives to it. Upon the whole it appeared very plainly that the plan of the Opposition was to let the Address go, but to resist the provisions of the Bill to the utmost.
It seems to me advantageous that this plan has been thus laid open, and I am therefore glad that I moved the concurrence with the Lords in such a manner as to give occasion to it.
MR. GRENVILLE TO THE KING
May 7, 1765,
I have the honor to inform your Majesty that the House of Commons continued sitting 'till near ten
o'clock this evening. The Regency Bill was read the first time yesterday and ordered to be read a second time to-day, but nothing at all was said on that occasion.
To-day, about two o'clock, Lord John Cavendish came up to me in the House, and told me that he intended to move for an Address to be presented to your Majesty, desiring that you would be pleased to name a person to be proposed to the House for Regent, and that his motion would be to the same effect, and almost in the same words, with that moved by Lord Lyttelton in the House of Peers. He made the motion for the Address accordingly just before the second reading of the Regency Bill, in a very few words, and was seconded by Mr. T. Townshend, junr.
Inclosed with this, I transmit to your Majesty an account of the several speakers in this debate, and in
the subsequent one, in the order in which they spoke. It did not seem that the proposition for the Address made great impression upon the House, especially after the answers which were given to it. There was nothing very particular in the debate, except that several gentlemen who were for the Address, having declared against the principle of the Regency Bill, they were told that it would be highly improper to present an Address to your Majesty to name a Regent, if they intended to reject the Bill afterwards in which the Regent was to be named. This debate lasted 'till near six o'clock; the question was then put upon that motion, but was carried in the negative without a division. The Bill was then read a second time, and the question put for committing it. This was opposed upon all the general arguments against any Regency Bill whatever, and against the particular provisions and clauses in the present Bill. General Conway spoke very strongly against the latter, but declared that he would vote for committing the Bill. This debate lasted 'till past nine o'clock, and upon the question being then put, it was carried for committing the Bill without any division.
After this, Mr. G. Onslow ', of Guilford, moved to put off the Committee to a longer day than Thursday, which was the day proposed by me to go into the Committee upon it agreeably to what had been done in the former Regency Bill, and which was agreed to accordingly, and the Committee fixed for Thursday without any division.
Mr. G. Cooke then moved to print the Bill, but this was objected to in point of time and regularity, and
because there was no occasion for it, the instances in which it differs from the last Regency Bill being so very few.
After some little debate, there was a division upon this question, 18 for printing it, and 117 against it, the greater part of the House being gone away before the motion was made. In general the debate was carried on pretty regularly upon the two principal questions, and seemingly very much to the satisfaction of the House, which was the reason that they did not venture to divide upon either of them, though they declared repeatedly that they would oppose the Bill in every stage of it, and particularly in the Committee.
Upon the whole I flatter myself that every thing has gone in a manner which will be agreeable to your Majesty, though as it is now past ten o'clock, I must, in obedience to your orders for dispatching the messenger with this account as soon as I can, reserve the further particulars until I have the honour of waiting upon your Majesty to-morrow morning.
MR. GRENVILLE TO THE EARL OF SANDWICH
Stowe, June 20, 1765
My dear Lord, � The messenger brought me your letter last night at twelve o'clock, just as I was getting into bed, which prevented my re-dispatching him 'till this morning.
I am much obliged to you for the detail you have given me of what has passed, but I hope you will excuse me if I cannot agree with you as to the propriety of my immediate return to town in consequence of it. This is the result of my opinion after having weighed the whole of the account which you have sent to me. You will consider that the King has not taken the least notice of any part of this business, even to your Lordship who are upon the spot; nor have you received through the channel of my Lord Chancellor any positive information what the King's intentions and dispositions now are, or are hereafter likely to be, with regard to his Administration, and to that influence which has suggested to him the thoughts of changing them.
In this state, whilst the favour and authority of the Crown still appear in direct opposition to each other, I own I am not eager to press my advice and services upon the King; nor do I see what benefit can be derived to His Majesty or to the public by my being in town.
When I took leave of the King, I asked his permission to stay in the country 'till Tuesday next, which he granted to me. My return to town before that time, uncalled for, will have the appearance of a desire to embarrass the arrangement which he is now endeavouring to form, and which I need not tell you will come on, or go off, just the same whether I am there or not; as the King would not in the present situation communicate it to me, and without that I certainly should not trouble
him upon the subject of it.
So far therefore from thinking it necessary, I do not think it even decent for me to change the time which was fixed and settled with the King for my stay in the country, unless I receive his commands to the contrary. I imagine that these reasons will induce the Duke of Bedford and Lord Halifax (to whom I take for granted you will show this letter) to come to the same resolution, or at least that they will be of sufficient weight with your Lordship to excuse me for not complying with your wishes and opinion, which I should be extremely desirous to do wherever my own conviction will allow of it.
If anything further passes, I shall be glad to hear of it; in the meantime I agree entirely with my Lord Chancellor in lamenting the difficulties which I fear the King and kingdom will fall into, and which must daily increase instead of diminishing, unless some certain plan is speedily formed and steadily pursued. I am, &c, &c, George Grenville.
MR. GRENVILLE TO MR. NUGENT
June 21, 1766
My dear Sir, � I have not the least doubt that our brethren in America will express great joy at the repeal of the Stamp Act, especially if they understand by it, as they justly may, notwithstanding the Declaratory Bill passed at the same time, that they are thereby exempted for ever from being taxed by Great Britain for the public support even of themselves, which this kingdom is to pay for them. I think they will be very ungrateful to our American patriots and our American merchants if they do otherwise; and if your correspondent, Mr. Reeve, and the rest of those gentlemen, will do the same by Buckinghamshire, and double tax themselves to take off our taxes, I will engage for my countrymen here that they shall express as universal joy and more gratitude for the future than we shall meet with from Mr. Reeve's correspondents in America. The event, however, will show the merit which those who have contributed to this measure are entitled to from this kingdom for the plan which they have followed in Great Britain, Ireland, and the colonies; and I do assure you that I do not envy them all the praise which they will reap from it. I know not the particular measures which you refer to concerning Scotland; but I suppose it is a relaxation of the laws of revenue there, which they are certainly as well entitled to, and will receive as gladly, as if they lived in America. I have the strongest reason to be satisfied that my brother, Lord Temple, has neither advised nor encouraged the publication of the History of the late Minority which you mention, and consequently all reasonings derived from a contrary supposition fall to the ground. I am, &c. George Grenville.
MR. GRENVILLE TO MR. WHATELY
July 20, 1766.
Dear Whately, � However desirous I am to enable you to contradict the various falsehoods which have been, and I know will be, industriously spread concerning the late transaction, yet I am sure you will see the utter impossibility of entering into a full detail of all that has passed, within the bounds of a letter, or of doing more than to give you some general outline of it and reserve the rest 'till I see you here, which for many reasons I wish may be as soon as is convenient to you. Lord Temple's sudden return to Stowe on Thursday night sufficiently shows that he had determined not to give his concurrence, and engage in the new, or rather old, system of men and measures. He saw Mr. Pitt but once, which was at Hampstead, on Wednesday. The proposition made to him was, to stand as a capital cypher in the most responsible situation in the kingdom, surrounded with other cyphers of a different complexion, the whole under the absolute guidance and nomination of Mr. Pitt, who was to hold the office of Lord Privy Seal, and consequently to run no risk or have any trouble but as far as he chose it. Every dependant of Mr. Pitt's was to be brought into office, and no other changes to be made but what were necessary for that purpose. It was not pretended that there was any change of measures, and the change of men consisted in giving three or four of the first offices of the kingdom to some of the immediate friends of Mr. Pitt, who, joined with General Conway, and the Rump of the last Administration, were to compose the present Ministry. This was the modest proposition to which Lord Temple was invited to accede, and which Mr. Pitt well knew that he would not consent to, before the King, in consequence of Mr. Pitt's advice, sent for him to come to town. His wish was union, but not obedience, which neither his rank, fortune, nor inclination will allow him to admit of in contradiction to the public opinion which he had declared last Sessions, and in support of some new measures which he foresees that he may probably not approve. He immediately rejected it as highly unfit to be made to him by one who knew that he would not accept it, and to whom in the like case he would not have offered it. He expressed his desire of union to strengthen the King's Government, and to give it both credit and stability, for which purpose he had endeavoured to divest himself of private affections and prejudices, and, as far as was possible, to bring into His Majesty's service as much weight and ability as could be got together at this critical conjuncture; that he was sorry to find that Mr. Pitt's plan was so very different from it, and that ideas of so little moderation and temper had taken possession of his mind; that as this was the case, it was needless to talk further upon principles so totally inadmissible. Here he wished to close it, and I rejoice extremely to be able to tell you that he expressly declined making any mention of me upon this occasion, which I think is much more for my dignity and honour, and for his own, as his refusal cannot now be attributed to personal views for his own family.
The causes assigned for his refusal, that it was because it was proposed to restore Mr. Mackenzie, and that too much consideration was had of Lord Bute in the intended arrangement, are, I am confident, without the least foundation, and I am still persuaded that neither Mr. Mackenzie's nor Lord Bute's name were ever mentioned in the whole conversation; but the account of Mr. Pitt's having refused a Cabinet Council office to Lord Lyttelton, and of his having objected to Lord Gower as Secretary of State, is I believe very true. I understand that his intention was to take the Privy Seal himself, to give the office of President of the Council to the Duke of Grafton, and those of the two Secretaries of State to Lord Shelburne and Mr. Conway. This is the great comprehensive plan as far as I have heard of it for giving that vigour, experience and ability to the public offices, and for restoring that union of all parties, that temper and harmony, that confidence and permanency in Government, which have been said to be so much wanted, and for the attainment of which the King has been prevailed upon to take the extraordinary step of sending for Mr. Pitt out of Somersetshire in contradiction to the opinion which His Majesty was said to have adopted last Sessions, of not seeing him except upon a plan and principles which had been previously explained to him. I do not hear how it was determined to fill up the vacancy made by Lord Temple's refusal, which must have been foreseen, and was certainly expected, and whether any alterations may now be made in this system, formed upon such disinterested, temperate, conciliating, and extended views. I take it for granted that they will all serve the King and the public without salaries, as we have been solemnly assured by the newspapers that they would, or at least that they would let them lie in the Treasury, where we have been repeatedly told with equal modesty and veracity, and half England really believes, that the three thousand pounds a-year which was payable to Mr. Pitt as Secretary of State now lie unapplied. To speak seriously, I am glad to hear from several hands that Lord Bute disclaims the present transaction, which is certainly founded upon principles widely different from those which I am told he laid down with such general approbation in the House of Lords last Sessions, and which I hear from many of his friends he is determined to abide by. As to my sentiments on this subject, I may be too much prejudiced to form them impartially, but at least you can bear me witness, as well as Sir Fletcher Norton, in the conversations I have had with him, that the language I have holden has been that of temper and moderation with respect to my own feelings, and a desire to promote it in every other man. I am very much obliged to Sir F. Norton for his good opinion of me, and for the manner in which you tell me he has expressed it, and still more so for the justice he does me. I at no time contended that Mr. Mackenzie should never hold any office, not even at the time when, for variety of reasons which you know, I carried to the King the proposition for removing him from the office of Lord Privy Seal of Scotland. Sir F. Norton, therefore, very justly thinks that it would be a strange thing if after what has passed, when he believes that Lord Bute has given up the idea of restoring him to the same office, and wishes even for an English one, that in return for it I should now take up and insist upon the contrary opinion. As to Lord Temple, I have not talked to him upon this subject. I cannot take upon me to give any answer, but Sir F. Norton must have heard his general sentiments from a friend of his, who has often talked to Lord Temple about Lord Bute and his friends. I am, &c, &c. George Grenville.
I trust this letter to your discretion, as the subject is of a delicate nature, to contradict any falsehoods which have been raised, or any wrong impressions which have been given.
