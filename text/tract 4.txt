And our Lord also declared the earnest wish and activity of the Spiritual Enemy to overcome the Faith of the Apostle Peter-. This is a clear Revelation that Human Nature is really liable to the impulse and temptations of wicked Spirits, which will certainly prevail over us, and become the Principles of Action, if we are not careful and vigilant to resist them as we ought: for Christ did not forbid the Tempter from using his endeavours against Peter, but only prayed that THE FAITH  of the Apostle should not fail; whereby he has taught us, that a sound and stedfast FAITH (for which WE ALSO are bound to pray) will sufficiently enable us to resist the POWERS OF DARKNESS.
But when Men disbelieve the very existence of those active Spiritual adversaries, how should they be upon their guard to resist their influence? For Unbelief in the existence of Spiritual Beings will certainly be promoted, even by the DEVILS themselves, in all places wherever they can gain advantage by it, and especially wherever Scepticism, Deism, and the groundless notions of the Sadducees, are openly set up in opposition to the clear testimonies of revealed Religion, and the true Faith: for in all such places, it is obvious, that the interest of Satan�s empire will be promoted by a disbelief of his existence; and consequently, that the Angels of Darkness will, in such places, most carefully abstain from every outward and visible demonstration of their agency and power among Men. Whereas at other time, and in other places, where ignorance of a contrary nature has prevailed, and Men have been subjected to superstitious terrors, by neglecting the only proper object of their confidence, in such places, I say, the Agency and Interference of DEMONS with Mankind have ever been notorious and manifest; of which the histories of all Heathen nations bear ample testimony.
The uniformity of Demon Worship, in all parts of the world, before the preaching of the gospel, affords also a clear proof of the worldly Empire of Satan; for though Devils were worshipped under various names, and various figures, yet there was a constant uniformity in all such particular points as tended most to the Destruction of Mankind, or to lead Men to the most direct opposition to the revealed Laws of God, whereby the universal Author or Promoter of such baneful devices was clearly discoverable; the same being for the most part contrary to the Nature of Man, and such, therefore, as could not naturally proceed from Man alone.
Hence we may plainly account for the universal adoption of Human Sacrifices amongst all Heathen Nations! Some of these deluded people withheld not even their own offspring from their Spiritual Deceiver; the spilling of Human Blood being most grateful to that Being, who �was a MURDERER from the beginning.� Hence we may also account for the Cuttings in the Flesh for the dead, and the marking or tattooing of the skin, which still prevails amongst the African and American nations, and the present uninformed Islanders of the South Seas, as much as it formerly did amongst the Picts, and other more ancient Heathens; for their marks in the flesh were certainly intended by the Spiritual Deceiver, as a sort of Dedication to himself, and as an affront to the Divine Creator, who formed Man without any such unnatural distinctions, and expressly commanded in his revealed.
And as the �forbidding to marry� is declared in Scripture to be �a Doctrine of Devils!� so we accordingly find, that amongst the ancient Heathens there was an order of Nuns or Priestesses (called Vestal Virgins) that were bound, contrary to Nature, in vows of CELIBACY; and amongst the Heathen Tartars, Chinese, and other idolaters, even to this day, there are distinct orders of Men, it seems, as well as Women, laid under the same unnatural restraint through the instigation of their spiritual Adversary; and yet the same Deceiver promoted, almost universally amongst the Heathen, as a sacred Rite, the promiscuous use of Women, in order to draw Men by their natural Lusts to join the superstitious Congregations of his Worshippers.
Of this kind were the Rites of Venus among the Greeks, Romans, and (more particularly among) the inhabitants of Cyprus: the shameful Rites of Astarte (whom the Heathens called Queen of Heaven) in her temple at Byblus: Those of Tanais, or Anaitis, among the Armenians: And those of MYLITIA, the Aphrodite, or Venus of the ancient Babylonians, and more Eastern nations, at whose shrines women of all ranks, even of the first quality, were required once in their lives to prostitute themselves. The impious Rites of BAALPEOR (whereby many of the Israelites were ensnared by �the Council of Balaam� seem to have been of the same kind; and to increase the temptation to Demon worship, it appears that the women of the first quality, among) the daughters of Moab and Midian, were not exempted from that most disgraceful and pernicious pollution, baneful both to body and soul: for the Midianitish woman, that prostituted herself to Zimri the Simeonite (and was killed, together with her captivated Israelitish paramour, by Phineas) is expressly declared to have been the daughter of Zur, who was �HEAD OVER A PEOPLE and of a CHIEF HOUSE in Midian.� And he is mentioned afterwards as one of the KINGS of Midian.
Thus �the Council of Balaam� promoted the service and worship of Devils; and this should warn us of the extreme danger of yielding to the crime of Fornication, which, in all ages and nations, has been used as a snare to vilify mankind, and enslave them to Spiritual Adversaries: for as THE FORBIDDING TO MARRY is unquestionable THE DOCTRINE OF DEVILS whereby those, who devote themselves to such unnatural commands, fall under more severe Temptation to FORNICATION, so, on the other hand, FORNICATION is reciprocal in its effects, by being one of the most baneful obstacles to lawful and virtuous MARRIAGE, and, consequently, to the increase and multiplication of mankind: but this, bad as it is, is not the worst consequence of habitual FORNICATION; for men, being thereby drawn away from the service and worship of their Creator, are gradually led to greater crimes, whereby their minds are more and more darkened, like those of the fallen Angels, until they are totally deprived of the Light and Image of their Creator, and lose both temporal and eternal Happiness!
When Men are in BONDAGE to their own Lusts, there is no doubt but that Satan has already �got an Advantage� over them; and, by their Lusts, and unrestrained Affections, does hold them in BONDAGE also to himself! So that a Man cannot free himself from Spiritual Bondage, without forsaking and repenting of his favourite sins; for we can have no direct idea of resisting the Devil (as the Scripture command us) but that of resisting Evil, wherever we perceive it, whether in thoughts, words, or actions. But when Men entirely neglect this necessary resistance to Evil, they are sure to be led on from one vice to another, till the two before mentioned natural and universal Principles in mankind, intended for their Preservation, viz. Common Sense (or Reason) and Self-love, have lose their influence: for the Actions of a great part of Mankind cannot be accounted for upon any other Principle than that of a lamentable BONDAGE to the SPIRITUAL ADVERSARY, who leads them to actions that are clearly contrary to Self-love and Common Sense, and contrary even to any probably gratifications that might afford a Temptation to Human Beings!-to actions that apparently tend to their own everlasting destruction!
How common is it for Men to lift their hands against their own life, and deliberately to exclude themselves from all possibility of repentance? It must be allowed indeed, that real Madness, or Lunacy, and other natural distempers and frenzies, are frequently deemed the Principles of Action which occasion Suicide; but we have too many instances of deliberate Self-murder, wherein no such natural causes can with Justice be alledged, though generally assigned by the coroner�s juries, through a false notion of mercy, which inclines them to adopt the erroneous maxim, that �all Men are mad who kill themselves.� But nothing is more false!
If the Brute Creation were equally liable to voluntary deaths, Suicide might with more probability be attributed to natural causes only, as they are almost equally liable to distempers: but herein appears a capital distinction between Human Nature and that of Brutes. None of the BRUTE CREATION ever violate the universal Principle of SELF-LOVE, which the Divine Author of Nature has given them for their preservation!
And though MAN is also endowed with the same principle, as I have already shown, yet the very BRUTES make so much better use of it than MAN, that in them we distinguish the same Principle, even by another name, and call it INSTINCT-an INSTINCT of Self-preservation-an Instinct, because it is never violated. How are we to account for this seeming Superiority in the BRUTES?
Why should HUMAN NATURE be more subject to Depravity than they are? MAN, who in addition to that natural Light with which he was endowed at the time of his Creation, has since acquired an additional power of discernment and prudence for his preservation, even a Divine Knowledge of GOOD and EVIL, that he �may know how to refuse the EVIL, and chuse the GOOD;� and yet is in general infinitely more depraved than the very BRUTES! Let any reasonable Man consider how impossible it is, by natural Causes, to account for so extraordinary a circumstance! That MAN, endowed with such a Superiority of Knowledge for SELF-PRESERVATION, and also endowed with Self-love in common with the rest of the Creation, should yet be subject to such monstrous Depravity, as to lose all sense of both, while the BRUTES are never known to violate that universal Principle, Self-love! except it be for a reasonable Cause, that they risk their own Lives in defence of their young, to preserve their species, or through gratitude, as Dogs will defend their masters, which surely is no Depravity! To what extraordinary cause then shall we attribute this very singular superiority of BRUTES in a circumstance so necessary to happiness. The cause is obvious, BRUTES have never been subjected to spiritual Delusions, or to be actuated by infernal Spirits, since the time that the Serpent deceived our first parents!
There is no instance, I believe, since that time, of BRUTES being really actuated by evil Spirits except one; and that was (be pleased to observe) by express Permission of our LORD himself, viz. when the Devils entered into the swine by the lake of Gennesareth. For it appears, that the Demons had no power to enter into the animals, till our Lord has expressly granted it. The PERMISSION being thus gained, the animals immediately acquired a new �Principle of Action,� too similar to that which actuates poor abandoned sinners among MEN (as when the Devil entered Judas, and led him not only to betray his Lord, but to punish the horrid treason with his own hands, contrary to every conceivable Natural Principle of Action) so the unhappy Brutes by Gennesareth were no sooner subjected, like Mankind, to the Bondage of infernal Spirits, than they immediately lost that Principle of Self-love, which in them (because never violated but at this particular time) is called Instinct; and by the immediate consequence of that loss, they have afforded us a notable example of the baneful effects of Diabolical Inspiration, to which at all other times Mankind alone are subjected.
Thus the Influence of EVIL SPIRITS became, manifestly, a Principle of Action in the poor Brutes, which overpowered their �Natural Instinct of Self-preservation,� and hurried them headlong to destruction; and the cause being known, it is very natural to conclude, when we see similar Effects in Human Beings, that the same �Principle of Action� may perhaps have produced them; especially if there be no previous circumstances of Distemper or Distraction, which may leave room to hope that another Cause might reasonably be assigned. And as the example also shows us, that Devils have no power to enter Brutes without express Permission of the Creator: let us, by a comparative consideration of the contrary nature of our own bodies, learn to be continually upon our guard against the devices and instigations of our spiritual Enemies, always remembering, that they need no such express Permission from God to enter the Human Body; or rather that God has already lodged the Power of permitting or resisting them, entirely in the Human Breast; since we are by Nature continually liable to receive the Inspiration of the Devil and His Angels as a �Principle of Action,� if we neglect the necessary Resistance commanded in the Scriptures; and consequently, that they already have Permission from God to enter all Human Beings, I mean all those that are capable of discerning between Good and Evil, and do not reject the Evil as they ought, according to that Divine Knowledge which we inherit from our first Parents!
This Peculiarity in our Nature is therefore apparently the reason why Spiritual Adversaries are permitted by the Almighty to approach Mankind, though they have no such general Permission with respect to the rest of the animal Creation. But Man took the Knowledge of Good and Evil upon himself, contrary to the express commands of God, as I have before remarked; and therefore we have no right to murmur at the Permission which God has granted to �the Devil and his Angels,� to take possession of all unguarded Souls, which unhappily yield to their suggestions and temptations, without resistance or repentance; and more especially we have no right to murmur (I say) at this Permission, if we consider that God has given us fair warning of our continual danger and warfare with the Principalities and Powers of Darkness, as the Holy Scriptures plainly inform us, that we are continually liable to Satanical influence; and that the DEVIL will get an advantage over us, if we do not resist him as we ought!
-In this necessary Resistance, and the objects of it, consist the principal exercise of that assumed Knowledge of Good and Evil, for which we are accountable; viz. we know Evil from Good, and consequently know when we ought to resist; but if we do not resist, then we have chosen the EVIL, and (in whatsoever mode the EVIL is manifest) have given Advantage to the Devil, and submit ourselves to his Bondage. The Choice therefore, which is set before us, amounts to this-Whether we will chuse �the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness,� and cheerfully assent (as the dignity of Human Nature requires) to that �perfect Law of Liberty,� which Christ has tendered to us for the regulation of our conduct towards all Mankind, as well as for Self-preservation? or-Whether we rather prefer the Empire of SATAN, the spiritual Enemy, for the sake of those temporal gratifications and vile indulgences, by which he holds Men in Bondage, through their carnal affections, till they become personal Enemies, even to themselves!
The assumed Principle of �knowing Good and Evil,� will undoubtedly induce all Mankind most readily to CHUSE �the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness;� but this is not a CHOICE to be made merely once in our lives, but to be continually maintained, or the prudent CHOICE will avail nothing! Are not Men in general bound by a solemn oath in the outward rite of Water-Baptism, thus to maintain that prudent CHOICE which they publicly profess? And yet how little do their practices in general correspond with such a resolution! Surely, with whom we have to WRESTLE, do apparently prevail over a great multitude in every rank of life!
But though Human Nature is thus liable to the Influence of �the Devil and his Angels,� let us remember at the same time for our comfort, that it is equally capable of being actuated by DIVINE INSPIRATION; and that Mankind (in the glorious FREEDOM of the Gospel) are equally left to their CHOICE for the admission of that supreme Good, �THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST,� to regulate their Principles of Action in all cases, as they are for the admission of the contrary Spirit, �the Prince of Darkness!� For the Promises of CHRIST relating to that heavenly Gift are clear and absolute, and are tendered to all Mankind without exception, that they may exercise their natural Knowledge of GOOD and EVIL, in CHUSING, ACCEPTING, and continually CLAIMING them, if they really prefer �the Kingdom of God� to �the Kingdom of this World!� Here is true Freedom! a Charter of inestimable Privileges! And after these general promises, our Lord appealed to the common Sense of his hearers concerning the efficacy of a son�s request to a natural Father, to obtain things that are necessary for him; and concludes thereupon- So that every Man, who devoutly, and with due Faith, claims that glorious GIFT according to the Promise, and with such a disposition of mind as the Scriptures require, will undoubtedly receive it, �for he is faithful that promised.�
I am well aware how uncommon it is to introduce these religious topicks into Tracts of Law, but as the Divine Influence of THE HOLY SPIRIT upon Mankind may certainly be esteemed the supreme �Principle of Action in Man,� I am obliged, by the nature of my subject, to cite some testimonies concerning the general effect of that heavenly Gift, to which all Mankind are entitled: for such is the compound Nature of Man, that Enquiries concerning �Human Nature,� and the Principles of �Human Actions,� cannot be fairly and usefully defined, without a careful examination of this Human Claim to DIVINE INSPIRATION; nor indeed without a careful warning also against that very opposite and foreign Spiritual Influence, which is equally liable to alter Human Nature, and become �the Principle of Action;� which I hope I have already sufficiently proved from Scripture. And therefore with respect to the former, viz. the inestimable Claim to Divine Inspiration which we hold in CHRIST, it is proper to be remarked, that the peculiar and necessary EFFECT of that glorious and heavenly Gift, is a total change in the Nature of Man (from his fallen State, before described, to �A NEW CREATURE�) by a Regeneration or New Birth through THE SPIRIT; to which God has also been pleased to annex (as necessary on our first public Admission to the Claims and Privileges of the Gospel) an outward visible Sign also, or typical Washing with Water; by which we bear a public or outward testimony of that true Faith, which alone can qualify our claim to the promise.
Thus Man, through the privileges of the Gospel, may become �A NEW CREATURE,� and may partake even of THE DIVINE NATURE, if his own earnest and sincere endeavours are not wanting; for the Apostle PETER has expressly declared, that this is one of the effects of our Lord�s most gracious promises. 
Hence the Dignity and Superiority of MAN over the rest of the visible Creation is manifest! We not only possess, by natural Inheritance from our first Parents, a DIVINE ATTRIBUTE (as I have already shown in the former part of this Tract) viz. the Knowledge of Good and Evil; but also, by a right use of that Knowledge, in CHUSING and preferring the Good, and in REJECTING and resisting the Evil, we are capable also (through Christ) of PARTAKING �even of the DIVINE NATURE;� so that if we consider this most extraordinary Privilege, which is tendered to us on the one hand, and that deplorable Condition on the other hand, which we shall probably fall into, if we neglect it (viz. the partaking of the Diabolical Nature by the inspiration of the Devil and his Angels; to which, as I have already shown, we are continually liable, if we do not watch, and resist); it must be evident that MAN is either the most glorious, or the most miserable and base of all other Creatures!
Surely the consideration of these things ought to be humble the pride of those inconsiderate persons, who, on account of mere temporal honours, and worldly possessions, are so lifted up above their brethren, as to forget that they have no natural Precedency; but expect that the multitude of inferiors in fortune should implicitly submit to the will of the worldly superior, in all things; and who also seem to lose all sympathetick concern, all sense of fellow feeling for the wants and sufferings of their poor dependants, as if they sprung from a different Stock, and were not of EQUAL DIGNITY in the SIGHT OF GOD!
But, alas, PRIDE is a Principle of Action, which occasioned the Fall even of SATAN himself, and of his Angels, and is equally pernicious to Human Nature; for it renders MANKIND more liable to forfeit that glorious Liberty, those inestimable Privileges, which I have before described, than any other vice! And the reason is plain; for THE PROUD MAN, of all others, is most liable to neglect that �ROYAL LAW,� which I have already mentioned-that GOLDEN RULE, by which their notions of political government, and their behavior to all Mankind, ought to be regulated; for if he was not guilty of this neglect, he would necessarily cease to be PROUD, he would cease to be uncharitable; he would cease to be an advocate for arbitrary Power, either in political Despotism, or in domestic Slavery, both of which now unhappily prevail almost throughout the whole world! for even the enlightened English Nation is no longer qualified to censure the unnatural Oppression of the Peasantry and lower orders of people in Russia, Poland, France, some Parts of Germany and in many other States, which are commonly called Christian; since the English Government have publicly favoured, and do continue to encourage the most abominable Oppressions that ever disgraced Mankind; I mean the AFRICAN SLAVERY IN THE BRITISH COLONIES! Let the Advocates for these Oppressions seriously and carefully consider the DIGNITY and EQUALITY of HUMAN NATURE, which I have described, as well as their own STATE OF PROBATION in this life, and the Forfeiture of inestimable Privileges to which they are continually liable, and I trust they will become sensible of their danger!
But, alas, there are many other causes of failure, which tend to deprive Mankind of that glorious and eternal Dignity, for which ALL MEN should be candidates: for besides the ordinary temptations of worldly Pleasures, which draw the bulk of Mankind from considering the true means of obtaining the glorious promises of the Gospel, how often are the minds of Men puffed up with Self-sufficiency, and the PRIDE OF HUMAN LEARNING, and too often even with SPIRITUAL PRIDE, whereby they suffer themselves to be perverted through the deceitfulness even of their own sophistry!
How can such Men avail themselves of the glorious Promise of DIVINE INSPIRATION, as �a Principle of Action,� if they form to themselves a Mode of believing, which is totally different from �the Faith once delivered to the Saints?�
Nevertheless they must allow, that FAITH is necessary for those who ASK; and how can Men be said to have the NECESSARY FAITH, who form to themselves notions of God�s HOLY SPIRIT, which are totally inconsistent with the DIVINE NATURE?
How can we conceive that �the SPIRIT OF GLORT and of GOD� �resteth upon� those who esteem that glorious and �Eternal Spirit� no otherwise than as a created Being, and a mere ministering Spirit; and who refuse to join in that excellent Form of Prayer, the Litany of the Church of England, merely because THE HOLY GHOST is therein addressed AS GOD? Is not this to do �despite unto THE SPIRIT of Grace?�
These Men may pray for the HOLY SPIRIT, indeed; but, with such erroneous conceptions of that GLORIOUS GIFT, it is impossible that they should RECEIVE that eternal �SPIRIT OF TRUTH,� till they have sincerely repented of their horrid blasphemies, and humbled their own haughty Spirits to receive the plain information of the Scriptures; for if our Belief in the HOLY TRINITY were set aside, the greatest part of those sacred Writings would become utterly unintelligible to us; because they must, in that case, seem to contain the grossest contradictions, as there are passages which, without that necessary doctrine, would surely appear inconsistent with grammar and common sense! The doctrine of the HOLY TRINITY is expressed in the Articles and Liturgy of the Church of England in such guarded terms, as cannot easily be misconstrued and perverted; and though a certain set of men may pretend to found their objections to the Church of England on some other Articles of less moment, yet I am thoroughly persuaded, that the said guarded Terms, concerning that ONE necessary Doctrine, are the principle causes of offence to many of those mistaken Clergymen, who lately petitioned Parliament that they might be exempted from Subscription to the Articles of the Church of England. But as a right Faith must seal and authenticate our claims to the inestimable privileges and immunities of the Gospel, and as the true Dignity of Human Nature cannot be attained without the Divine Assistance, and the Inspiration of God�s Holy Spirit, whereby Men are made partakers (as I have already shown) of the Divine Nature, some knowledge of the latter (so far as the Almighty hath been pleased to reveal himself to us) is absolutely necessary for those Persons who desire to be acquainted with the Law of Nature, and �the Principles of Action in Man:� and therefore some observations relating to the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, are by no means foreign to the subject and intention of this Tract. But it is an awful mystery, that must be received more by Faith in what God has been pleased to reveal to us, than by Human Comprehension. The finite understanding of the NATURAL MAN cannot, in this life, conceive an adequate idea of that glorious and eternal BEING, which in every attribute is infinite perfection! Nay, even if we had a perfect Knowledge of that which is now so far above us, yet no language could supply words, no rhetorical figures of comparison could be found to express that Knowledge! And it would, therefore, remain unuttered, in these lower Regions, like those �unspeakable Words� which were heard by the Apostle Paul� when he was �caught up into Paradise!�
