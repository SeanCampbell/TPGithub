Lord Rockingham, has called here twice, and I have called upon him as often upon this business. I took occasion the last time to tell him, to prevent the possibility of the least disappointment in my conduct, that I should certainly be very much governed by your Lordship�s opinion, and whatever my first impressions might have been, should I lend a willing mind to your reasoning on the subject, or very for very obvious reasons. I told him further in general terms, that I had reason to believe your Lordship�s opinion to be, that Ireland was the proper place for opposition to the measure, and that here it became a very different question, whether to advise the Crown to reject the desire of the Irish Commons in matter of supplies. I desired it might be in confidence, as I was not accustomed to say more than what regarded myself, except when particularly desired. He expressed great surprise, apprehended that if any measure could produce general union, and draw a person from the country, it must be this, which from daily conversations and accounts, as well �as from the nature of it, could not fail to interest and animate the whole kingdom. He concluded by supposing, that either my impetuosity or over-warmth, or some defect in the statement of the question, could alone have given such an inclination to your Lordship�s Judgment, and that upon a fuller statement and further consideration you might come to adopt a different judgment. I entered as lightly as I could into this part; content to answer my own object, and desirous to commit your Lordship�s opinion as little as possible without your particular desire. 
I propose returning to London to-morrow evening, where I expect to find the same feebleness and uncertainty in the political world which for some time past has been the characteristic of it. Some of Lord Rockingham�s friends alone are capable of thinking things advancing; and it is, I understand, his Lordship�s and their intention to have a question offered to both Houses upon the Irish business. If I had the least influence, I should certainly deprecate such a measure, because I do not conceive that either Ireland or America can ever gain by the interposition of Parliament here; and it can answer no good purpose to the public, or individuals, to call upon every acting man for a creed regarding Ireland. However, if it does come on, my opinion will naturally lead me to condemn the justice and the policy of such a tax as was proposed, as inconsistent with any degree of connection, much more of dependence, of Ireland on Great Britain. I shall, at the same time, acknowledge the great principle of the constitution your Lordship dwells upon; that of the competency of the House of Commons to judge of all matters of supply, in every part of the King�s dominions, and the in advisedness of any interference, by the King or otherwise, with this their exclusive privilege, reserving the negative of the King, as well as the controlling power of the British Parliament, to be exercised in matters of commercial regulation.
I am particular in stating this, because I apprehend that I may be the only person in either House of Parliament who will go so far without descending to managements, which every day�s observation confirms me in wishing to avoid. The Ministers, I understand, are come round to join with the most violent in condemning the policy, and I suppose will not be less ready to join them in upholding Poynings� Act, and all the old doctrine of the dependence of Ireland upon England, in all cases whatsoever. I shall therefore be very anxious to know how far the reservation I have stated meets your Lordship�s idea, as I expect whatever debate occurs will turn upon that, or some other distinction which may be offered in favour of the supreme authority of the mother-country.
On Thursday night Mr. Charles Fox received a letter from Lord North, acquainting him that the King had ordered a new commission to be made out for the treasury, and that his name should be left out of it. I know nothing from any authority of his successor. The town talks of Lord Beauchamp, or Sir William Meredith, or Mr. Cornwall.
In the mean time, the public have been amused with a very solemn trial in the House of Lords upon literary property; which ended in the reversal of certainly a very extraordinary decree of Lord Mansfield�s, who showed himself the merest Captain Bobadil that, I suppose, ever existed in real life. I ought, instead of being a bad writer, to be a good painter, to convey to your Lordship the ridicule of the scene. You can, perhaps, imagine to yourself the Bishop of Carlisle, an old metaphysical head of a college, reading a paper, not a speech, out of an old sermon book, with very bad sight, leaning on the table; Lord Mansfield sitting at it, with eyes of fixed melancholy, looking at him, knowing that the Bishops were the only eyes in the House who could not meet his; the judges behind him full of rage at being drawn into so absurd an opinion, and abandoned in it by their chief; the Bishops waking, as your Lordship knows they do, just before they vote, and staring on finding something the matter; while Lord Townshend was close to the bar, getting Mr. Dunning to put up his glass to look at the head of criminal justice. He has not reappeared since in the House of Lords, and all Westminster Hall behold his dejection without, I believe, one commiserating eye.
You will read Lord North�s proposition in the newspapers, to change the port from Boston, till the assembly has indemnified the India Company, and to enable the king afterwards, if he judges proper, then to restore it. Colonel Barr� tells me that, finding the Rockinghams divided, that is, Mr. Dowdeswell, after some hesitation, directly opposing, and Lord John Cavendish rather tending to approbation and decidedly declining a division, thought the best service he could do to America was to support government to a certain degree, avowing his original principles, and that he might have more weight to resist propositions of a more coercive nature, which might be offered in the prosecution of this business, which is to come on again on Friday. I accidentally met Lord Dartmouth yesterday morning at Mr. Wilmot�s. Without entering into the particular measures in question, he stated, with great fairness and with very little reserve, the difficulties of his situation, the unalterableness of his principles, and his determination to cover America from the present storm, to the utmost of his power, even to repealing the act; which I urged to him as the most expedient step, the first moment he could bring his colleagues to listen to such a measure. This, together with Lord North�s language, which Colonel Barr� tells me was of a moderate cast, leads me to hope the further measures will not be so hostile as was expected. The Port Bill underwent a fuller, and by all accounts a fairer, discussion on Tuesday in the House of Lords than it did in the House of Commons. The debate took a general turn; and Lord Camden, in his reply to Lord Mansfield, met the question fully, and even as near the extent of his former principles as he could well do. The remarkable features of the day were the notorious division among the Ministry, which was very near avowed, some calling what passed in Boston commotion, others open rebellion, a more than disregard to Lord Dartmouth, and somewhat of the same sort towards Lord North. Lord Mansfield took upon himself a considerable lead: alleged that it was the last overt act of high treason, proceeding from over-lenity and want of foresight ; that it was, however, the luckiest event that could befall this country, for that all might be recovered; compensation to the India Company he regarded as no object of the bill; that if this Act passed, we should be passed the Rubicon; that the Americans would then know that we should temporize no longer; and if it passed with tolerable unanimity, Boston would submit, and all would pass sine Caedi.
The House allowed me very patiently, though very late at night, to state the tranquil and the loyal state in which I left the colonies, with some other very home facts; and I cannot say I met with that weight
of prejudice I apprehended. Lord Temple having come down to attend General Frazer�s bill, declared, early in this debate, that he did not intend voting, or giving any opinion on the measure, but that the backwardness of the Ministers to explain their plan appeared an indignity to the House; that they were mistaken if they thought the measure a trifiing one; that in his opinion nothing could justify the Ministers hereafter, except the town of Boston proving in an actual state of rebellion; but he feared the Ministry had neither heads nor hearts to conduct either system. During the whole debate the Ministers would never declare whether they would this session repeal the Act or not. In regard to their plan, Lord Dartmouth appeared to stop, after declaring the proposed alteration of the charter; but Lord Suffolk declared very plainly, that other very determined measures should be offered, before the end of the session. The landed property, except some of the most sensible, are, as is natural, I believe, for violent measures. The interest of the commercial part is very decidedly on the other side, and their passions are taking that turn.
His Majesty, is extremely sorry to observe any degree of ill-temper remaining in his Colony of Massachusetts Bay, or that points should be so improperly agitated as to tend to the revival of disputes which every friend to America must wish to be forgotten. They have seen the Parliament of Great Britain give due attention to all well founded complaints of the Provinces, notwithstanding they appeared to them in some parts not so properly urged. Though the Legislature will certainly on all just occasions exercise and enforce its Legislative power over the Colonies, yet it cannot be doubted but it will exert it with a due regard to the nature of their connection with the mother-country.
Upon this occasion it is proper to observe in general that the ease and honour of His Majesty's government in America will greatly depend on the temper and wisdom of those who are entrusted with the Administration there, and that they ought to be persons disdaining narrow views, private combination, and partial attachments. A temperate conduct founded on the true basis of public good, avoiding all unnecessary reserve where nothing arbitrary is thought of, nothing unreasonable required, must carry conviction to the hearts of the deluded, conciliate the minds of all, and insure the confidence of his Majesty's loyal and loving subjects of America.
Upon these considerations I am persuaded that the Assembly will immediately upon their meeting fall upon measures to terminate all local difficulties, which appear by your accounts to have hitherto prevented that compliance expected by Parliament, with the recommendations you have been required to make, in consequence of the resolutions of both Houses. It is impossible to conceive that they will suffer any private considerations to interfere with their desire of showing a proper sense of that paternal regard which they have experienced from his Majesty, and of that attention which Parliament has given to their complaints, which can never be done with more propriety than by granting with the utmost cheerfulness, a just compensation to those who have suffered by the late disorders.
I write to acquaint you of three very material points, which are thought to require the deliberation of the King's servants in order to their being laid before him.
1st. A proper system for the management of the Indians, and for the carrying on the commerce with
them on the most advantageous footing.
2nd. The most eligible manner of disposing of the troops; as well for convenience as for offence and defence.
3rd. A reduction of the contingent expenses of the establishment in North America, and the raising an American fund to defray American expenses in part or in whole.
As so much depends upon the happy regulation of these different articles, they require to be well weighed before a final resolution can be taken upon them, and as the King is desirous that they shall be regulated with all the dispatch that is consistent with securing both the permanence and honor of his Government, and the prosperity of his American subjects, every light and information which can be added to those we are already possessed of, will be duly attended to.
You will therefore pay the utmost attention to these three points, and from time to time transmit such information and reflections upon them as shall occur to you.
In regard of the first article, that of the Indian affairs, a plan formed some time ago has been under deliberation. As this plan was transmitted to all the governors in North America for their opinions, it must have fallen within your observation. Many articles in it however appearing not so well calculated for the end proposed as could be wished, and several others being rather detrimental to it, there is a necessity either of reforming it, or of substituting another in its place. But it is to me matter of doubt whether any method of managing Indians can be found preferable to that of leaving the trade of each province to the particular care of that province, under some general rules and restrictions to which all the provinces must be subject in general. 
A plan drawn up by Lord Barrington has been some time under consideration for quartering the troops. This matter will be fully discussed here, but as it is possible that in the end His Majesty may leave it in great measure to your prudence and judgment, you will lose no time to consider this point fully. In the meantime it is His Majesty's desire, that in any changes of the present disposition you have occasion to make, regard be had to make the military as little burdensome to the inhabitants as possible, by disposing them preferably among the young colonies, where in many respects they must be considered as advantageous, rather than in His Majesty's more settled colonies, except where they are desired, or in your opinion wanted.
The third article is that of the greatest consequence, and therefore merits the most particular and mature consideration.
The forming an American fund to support the exigencies of Government in the same manner as is done in Ireland, is what is so highly reasonable that it must take place sooner or later. The most obvious manner of laying a foundation for such a fund seems to be by taking proper care of the quit-rents, and by turning the grants of lands to real benefit, which might tend to increase rather than diminish the powers of Government in so distant a country.
You must be sensible that very great abuses have taken place in both respects which cry aloud for redress.
Proper regulations for these purposes might be a means of preventing Indian disturbances in future, which now in great measure arise from individuals possessing themselves of their lands without the knowledge of Government.
It is far however from His Majesty's intention that any rigour should be exercised in respect of quit-rents long due, but nothing can be more reasonable than that the proprietors of large tracts of land (which ought by the terms of the respective grants to have been cultivated long since) should either pay their quit-rents punctually for the time to come, or relinquish their grant in favour of those who will.
As to the manner of making out grants of land for the future, I could wish to have the best information possible, so that such a system might be adopted for that purpose, particularly in the new and conquered Provinces, as would at the same time serve to promote the good of the Colonies, and lighten the burden which lies upon the mother-country.
Although the reduction of expense in America is a very necessary point, yet I must do the Treasury the justice to say, that they do not wish to retrench any expense which can contribute to the advantage of the country or the good of the service; on the contrary, the intention is that no expense shall be spared which is really useful, but that none shall be incurred which is not so. And indeed it is hardly possible that many articles of expense very necessary at the time, which the exigencies of the war required to be entered into without delay, should not now require reformation and admit of being retrenched. But this desirable point can only be effected by a thorough digest and judicious arrangement of the different departments in America. You cannot therefore be too full in giving your own thoughts upon these matters, nor in procuring the very best intelligence possible from your correspondents in all the Provinces to be transmitted to me from time to time also.
In regard to America, the inclosed minute from the House of Commons will show your Lordship Mr. Grenville's question. Mr. Townshend answered him, but agreed as to the principle of the Stamp Act and the duty itself; only the heats which prevailed made it an improper time to press it; and treating the distinction between external and internal taxes as ridiculous in everybody's opinion except the Americans, pledged himself in short to the House to find a revenue, if not adequate, (a word Lord George Sackville pressed him with, with a view to pin him down as much as possible,) yet nearly sufficient to answer the expense, when properly reduced. What he means, I do not conceive. I have always thought the quit-rents may be so managed, without having too great a retrospect, as to produce a certain sum; and I have likewise had reason to think that such a new method of granting lands might be devised, as might give infinite satisfaction to America, contribute to the ascertaining property by preventing future suits at law, in great measure prevent the Indian disturbances, and besides all this incidentally produce a certain revenue, without its being the object; but I do not conceive either of them can possibly take place this year, there not being materials in any office here sufficient to form a final judgment of them. Many of them must come for that purpose from America.
I have heard, indeed, from general conversation, that Mr. Townshend has a plan for establishing a board of customs in America, and by a new regulation of the tea duty here, and some other alterations, to produce a revenue on imports there. I am myself in no respect able to form a judgment how far this may be likely to answer the end or no; but in many views it appears a matter that will require the deepest consideration, at this time especially. Besides I believe your Lordship will think the speech I have just mentioned to you is not the way to make any thing go down well in North America.
I thought it necessary to inform your Lordship thus far of the state of American affairs here, before I came to speak of the actual state of them there. They have universally agreed to the compensation required by Parliament to be made to the sufferers. My letter upon that subject, in Massachusetts Bay has undergone a very free discussion; but they have fully agreed, and the Assembly have written me a letter, which I enclose to your Lordship. The governor writes short, but inveighing in general terms against the people.
A petition is at the same time come from New York, signed by two hundred and forty persons, to the House of Commons, and sent to the Board of Trade to present; who have transmitted it to me, to know the King's pleasure upon it. I likewise find that when the last ships came away the Assembly had my letter under consideration; which your Lordship may remember was written after a council, upon Sir Henry Moore's and General Gage's accounts of the difficulty made by the Assembly to provide the troops with vinegar and other articles, which Sir Jeffery Amherst's letters assure him they will not comply with, lest they should admit what might hereafter be deemed a precedent for a Tax Act.
I have only told the merchants in general that it was well known some of those who opposed the Stamp Act opposed it upon very extensive principles with regard to American trade, upon a supposition that the advantages of it must finally centre with the mother-country; that these objects could never be considered separate: to consider them together required not only great judgment and great power, but temper too; leaving it to them to judge how very imprudently the present moment was chosen, when on the one hand they saw how far the prejudices about the Stamp Act still prevailed, and on the other an assembly imprudent enough to hesitate about obeying an Act of Parliament in its full extent, after the tenderness which had been shown America; not to mention their manner of sending it over. The merchants and the Americans here seem sensible of its being the height of imprudence, and are sorry; but your Lordship may easily conceive it has occasioned a number of reports, and is likely, in the talk of the town, to undergo the imputation of rebellion, and will probably be mentioned as such by Mr. Grenville in the House of Commons without seeing it.
The King's commands, and the importance of whatever determination is taken in regard to America, must excuse me to your Lordship for breaking in upon you, when I know your intention is to be in town if well enough; if not, that the same reason which detains you, may make business altogether inconvenient. In the last case I hope you will make no scruple to lay aside my letter. It is the general opinion that the present packet should not go to America without some determination of government after the imprudent conduct of New York, as well on account of appearance here, as effect there. I have therefore stopped its sailing in order to submit my own thoughts to your Lordship, before I execute the rest of the King's commands by laying it before the rest of his servants. I wish I could at the same time acquaint you with the opinions of the other ministers, but though everybody is strongly for enforcing, nobody chooses to suggest the mode. I presumed to ask the King whether any occurred to His Majesty, but I could not find that any had, except that it should be enforced. Enclosed I send your Lordship all that I have received from Lord Barrington; which contains a general account of the Act. It was first suggested by the military, and intended to give a power of billeting on private houses, as was done in the war. It was altered by the merchants and agents, who substituted empty houses, provincial barracks, and barns, in their room, undertaking that the Assembly should supply them with the additional necessaries: and it passed, I believe, without that superintendence or attention on the part of Government, which is so wanted in all cases where necessity requires something different from the general principles of the constitution. I am told it was carried through by Mr. Ellis, without the entire conviction or cordial support of Mr. Grenville, who made it a separate Bill lest it might embarrass the General Mutiny Act.
The infatuated conduct of the Assembly in refusing even present obedience to the Act, precludes I am afraid all consideration of the merits or principles of it, by involving a far greater question. I have however examined with all the attention possible the Mutiny Act here, and find it amazingly tender both in regard to Scotland and Ireland. That part of it only which regards the discipline extends to Ireland. It is very extraordinary that by the best information I have been able to procure, the troops are quartered there under no direct law whatever here or there, but either on account of old prerogative or custom, or the necessity of the thing being understood, it is generally submitted to.
As things stand in America, so many considerations cross upon each other, that all the difficulties of the situation are scarce within compass to be stated. One great difficulty however is, that whatever the conduct of New York or even of America may be, arising from the diffidence and excess of apprehension your Lordship mentions, it were to be wished not to establish a precedent in whatever is done, which may hereafter be turned to purposes of oppression and to promote measures opposite to those general public principles upon which the Stamp Act was repealed. Another is that if these infatuated people should be tempted to resist in the last instance, which there is the greatest reason to apprehend from the Governor's letter and their address, I think it too plain from the accounts we daily receive that France and Spain would no longer defer breaking a peace, the days of which they already begin to count, though I profess and very sincerely feel the want of that experience and sagacity necessary to form any judgment of the intentions of foreign Powers.
Tour Lordship will have received the Duke of Grafton's letter with an account of the present state of the Indian business, which I am extremely glad to find meets your Lordship's intention. His Grace, I take it for granted, has enclosed to you the minute of Cabinet, stating their proposal as it stands being unintelligible, with several queries, upon which they were desired to explain themselves. The Duke of Grafton has since seen the Chairman and Deputy Chairman; who said they were infinitely obliged to every Lord of the Cabinet for not commanding their attendance, as they must have been silent. They desired for that reason to put the paper of queries in their pocket, without reading it till they got to the India House, where they would prepare the answer, but were afraid it was impossible to do it so soon as Friday; which leaves it open to Mr. Beckford to state himself as ready, which I understand he is, to go into the inquiry, having delayed it hitherto more out of candour to Mr. Townshend's declaration than his own opinion, which has always been that it could not be transacted out of Parliament, and will give Mr. Townshend and Mr. Conway an opportunity in answer, to state the matter as it is: that there has been a proposal, which not being sufficiently clear to lay before Parliament, has been returned to the directors for further explanation upon it, which they have promised to give, but has not yet been received. The consequence I suppose must be further adjournment, for at least a week longer. If this meets your Lordship's idea, I will take care to give it all possible attention, and will make it my business to see Mr. Beckford upon it, and that it shall be properly understood. If it does not, I beg your Lordship to let me have your further commands any time to-morrow. I am sure I need not endeavor to express to your Lordship my concern for the occasion of your delay, or for the inconvenient situation I am afraid you find yourself in.
I have His Majesty's command to transmit to you an Act of the last session of Parliament for restraining and prohibiting the Governor, Council, and House of Representatives of the province of New York, until provision shall have been made for furnishing the King's troops with all the necessaries required by law, and from passing or assenting to any Act of Assembly, vote or resolution for any other purpose.
This law you will perceive was enacted for the purpose of enforcing the obedience of the Assembly of New York to the terms of the Mutiny Act, but at the same time framed with that singular temper and lenity as to offer that Assembly an opportunity of rectifying their conduct, and this without involving them in any disabilities except as the consequence of further disobedience, nor is the province itself subjected to inconvenience thereby, without leaving it in the power of the people by a proper conduct and a due exertion of their privileges to avoid or remove them.
Since the passing this Act I have received your letter of June 18th acquainting me that the Assembly have in their address to you declared their intention of making that provision for the troops which is prescribed by the Mutiny Act.
I lost no time in laying this letter before his Majesty who was graciously pleased to express his satisfaction that his province of New York had voluntarily returned to a just sense of their duty, and had thereby given an unquestionable proof of their duty to His Majesty, and of their obedience to the Parliament of Great Britain. 
Whilst I transmit this Act, it is with real pleasure I consider that the prudent conduct of the Assembly has already rendered the provisions contained in it unnecessary, and I entertain no doubt but that the same just spirit of subordination and constitutional obedience to that supreme Legislature, which has on all occasions discovered the clearest intentions of restraining its own power within the limits of equity and justice, will render New York equally worthy with the rest of His Majesty's provinces of His Majesty's favour and protection, and of those singular privileges which they enjoy under the blessings of his reign, and under the influence of the British constitution.
I cannot be so near Hayes without communicating to your Ladyship from London an event of a personal nature. It is General Conway's resigning the emoluments of his office as Secretary of State, on account of certain delicacies he felt for what passed last summer in regard to Lord Rockingham. It has been some time in agitation, but was not communicated to me, till General Conway mentioned it, at the moment the Duke of Grafton was gone in to the King to acquaint His Majesty finally of his resolution. I must own, when it was first told me, I felt it an agreeable opening for me to do the same; and that I might by that means be freed from various delicacies, and some uneasiness in a situation in which Lord Chatham placed me, and which without his approbation I did not think myself at liberty to desert. Upon weighing it, however, I must own I saw as many objections, and what concluded me to defer such a step was, that I thought it wrong to do a thing, which however rightly intended, might have the air of experiment, without Lord Chatham's example or concurrence.
I know not how to make your Ladyship sufficient excuses for troubling you upon any subject of business; I am afraid it is not a sufficient one, to say it is an ease to my own mind, to acquaint your Ladyship of it, so that if Lord Chatham should chance to hear of it, you might have the goodness to acquaint him of the motives of my conduct. 
As for the course of public affairs, what regards Parliament I conceive may, with common management, be carried through without difficulty. As for the Court, Lord Chatham knows my opinion, as it has been unvaried since I first waited upon him at Northend. As to foreign affairs, there are many accounts which certainly do not flatter the almost universal wish of peace; but if there should any certainty come of any such great event as a war, I shall presume to acquaint your Ladyship of it, without troubling you with too many particulars. In the meantime, I have every reason to believe nothing can so effectually keep it off, as the report of Lord Chatham's health.
The terms your Excellency mentions fall within the rule His Majesty has laid down as not to be departed from, that his Ministers stand precluded from proposing to him the granting of places and pensions for life or years. It must therefore remain with the leading persons in Ireland to act in this matter in such a manner as they can answer to their own consciences, as servants to His Majesty, as men of property, and as representatives of the people, to whom they will be accountable for their conduct, and for the evil consequences which may be ascribed to the failure of this measure, which has been so strongly recommended to them by His Majesty. At the same time I may acquaint your Excellency that the King will certainly at the end of the session graciously take into his royal consideration the merits of those who shall have exerted themselves for the support of his Government and the good of Ireland; nor is it to be supposed that the conduct of those who shall have acted from motives of a less honourable nature can escape His Majesty's notice.
