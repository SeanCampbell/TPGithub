TO MR. JOHN WILKES.
SIR,
YOU have said, 'The public have a right to truth, and every imposition on mankind ought to be detected and exposed.' I am not entirely of that opinion: I think there are certain seasons when some particular truths ought to be withheld; and my lips should have been for ever closed on the subject of your real character and conduct, if you could by any motives have been persuaded, or by any art or contrivance have been compelled, to continue a voluntary or involuntary instrument of good to your country. I have long been, with others, struggling to make it your interest to be honest, and founded all my hopes, not on your principle, but common sense. At length I despair of any good from you, and apprehend much mischief: I think it therefore my duty to he no longer silent; and I come to an explanation without any apprehension of disgrace; because I know, that, though if likes and Liberty may for a while bear down every thing before them in the street, yet, as far as they are not connected by public principles, they will surely be separated in the closet. But, whatever may be the opinions of any persons concerning my conduct, I shall not alter it: their uninformed opinions affect me little: I know my own situation; I must ever remain a poor and a private man, and can never be a candidate for the favour or confidence of the public. The voice of the people is not the voice of God to me, though (in the fair meaning of the word people) 1 have never thought it wrong; but it is the voice within me that shall ever be the guide of my actions.
It is not my intention here to open any account with you on the score of private character; in that respect, the public have kindly passed an act of insolvency in your favour: you have delivered up your all, and no man can fairly now make any demand. I blame your public conduct, and never had a difference with you on any other subject; and though it 'l has suited your selfish politics to insinuate and pretend some private pique between us, yet you have not ventured, even anonymously, to suggest any particular cause of my dissatisfaction.
That I may be well understood, it is necessary to give a short history of the commencement, progress, and conclusion of the intercourse between us; and this I will begin to do in my next; not for my own justification, for I could be well contented to leave each man to his opinion concerning me; but that the people at large, to whose safety and happiness it is important, may be better able to form their judgment how far they ought, and how far they ought not, to support you; and that they may perceive your general professions and protestations to be like those of last Wednesday's speech, equally calculated to mislead and impose, and to which every particular act, as well of your opposition as of his government, is a flat contradiction.
John Horne.
TO MR. JOHN WILKES.
 SIR,
THE motives of my conduct, and the nature of our intercourse, (for it cannot be called a connexion,) will best appear from the situation of each of us at its commencement. Your motives will appear as plainly in its progress and conclusion.
When your troubles began, I was in France. I returned to England towards the end of the year 1764.
I was quickly informed of all the political transactions in England during my absence. My expectations and opposite connexions were not so strong in me as those principles, which all who know me know I always professed, long before there was a probability that the times would ever call them out into practice. In this situation, I did not hesitate one moment about my conduct, but instantly declared my sentiments very freely; and, during my short stay in England, contributed my mite to the public cause by publishing whatever essays, hints, or intelligence, I thought might be useful.
In the year 1765 I repaired to Italy. Passing through Paris, I delivered some letters to you; amongst others, one of those letters from Mr. Onslow, which you have since published. Though this was the first time we ever saw each other, you exacted from me, with very earnest entreaty, a promise of correspondence.
I thought you at that time sincerely public-spirited, and a man of honour; I mean that sort of honour, which, though it does not restrain from bad, prevents men from being guilty of mean actions. I wrote to you from Montpelier; and, lest from my appearance you should mistake my situation, and expect considerable services from me, I thought it proper to inform you, that I was only a poor country clergyman, whose situation, notwithstanding his zeal, would never enable him to perform any considerable service either to you or the public. Having told you my profession, I disclaimed, in a joking manner, those vices, which, from the dependent situation of its professors, are too frequently attendant on it � I mean hypocrisy, servility, and an abject attention to private interest. Receiving no answer, I did not repeat my folly: and, upon a second visit to you at Paris, in my return from Italy to England, in the year 1767, I saw reasons sufficient never more to trust you with a single line; for I found that all the private letters of your friends were regularly pasted in a book, and read over indiscriminately, not only to your friends and acquaintance, but to every visitor.
In this second visit at Paris you reproached me for not keeping my promise of correspondence, and swore you had not received my letter. I was very well contented, though I did not believe your excuse, and hugged myself in the reflection, that I had furnished you with only one opportunity of treachery. This letter you copied some months, and showed it about to numbers of people, with a menace of publication, if I dared to interrupt you. And yet you cannot pretend to justify yourself by saying, that it contains any promises which have not been abundantly fulfilled. So far from promising assistance, if I have any memory, it declares an inability to assist. You will not say that I courted you in your prosperity, and forsook you in adversity; you will not say that I have been ungrateful, or that I ever received any favours at your hands. I found you in the most hopeless state: an out- law; plunged in the deepest distress; over-whelmed with debt and disgrace; forsaken by all your friends, and shunned by every thing  that called itself a gentleman, at a time when very honest men, who could distinguish between you and your cause, and who feared no danger, yet feared the ridicule attending a probable defeat. Happily, we succeeded, and I leave you, by repeated elections, the legal representative of Middlesex, an alderman of
London, and about thirty thousand pounds richer than when first I knew you; myself by many degrees poorer than I was before; and I pretend to have been a little instrumental in all these changes of your situation.
I make no other reflection on your behaviour respecting my letter, than barely to say, that those who shall attempt to palliate or justify it, will want a justification themselves. Publish it, however, when you will. I am confident, as indeed I have likewise been assured by many to whom you have shown it, that there is nothing in the letter of which I need to be ashamed, unless there are any compliments to you; of every thing of that kind your subsequent conduct has indeed made me most heartily ashamed. �
John Horne
TO MR. JOHN WILKES
SIR,
My first employment on my return to England was to reconcile you with Mr. Cotes,whom I thought you treated, in his misfortunes, with a barbarous ingratitude: and at Paris I explained to you my sentiments on the subject, as freely as a stranger could who wished not to offend you. From this time, till your arrival in England, I threw out hints in the papers of your intention to offer yourself a candidate at the ensueing general election; and I endeavoured, with as much art as I was master of, to let them be just strong enough to make those who wished you well suppose the event possible, without being so strong as to make those who feared such an event suppose it probable.
From the time I left you at Paris, in 1 767, I held no communication with you of any kind whatever; nor did I, upon your arrival in England, in 1768, even pay you a visit, till it was very evident you had lost your election in the city. Then indeed I went to you, because I knew I could be useful to you in Middlesex; and I did then, and do still think, that there was no method by which I could do greater service to the public, than by espousing your cause; which the weakness and wickedness of our court had made, to a certain degree, the cause of every Englishman.
Besides some credible information which I had received since I first saw yon concerning your character, and the danger which my second visit had shown me there was in your correspondence, a particular transaction had made me forbear any communication with you, though my sentiments of your cause remained unaltered. � In October, 1766, you came over to England privately: my brother-in-law, Mr. Wildman, accidentally met you in the street, near his own house, in Argyle Buildings, in company with your brother, Mr. Heaton Wilkes: Mr. Wildman expressing his surprise to see you, you told him you were distressed to find some place where you might safely lay hid from fear of the outlawry: he offered you his own house; where you stayed till you went back again to France. You represented to him your situation in France, which made it proper for you to endeavour, by little presents, &c., to please your friends there, to whom you bad obligations; and requested him to procure for you certain articles , to the value of forty pounds, and to send them directed for your friend Mons. Sainte Foy, at Paris; to whose hands you said they would come without difficulty, examination, or interruption, he being secretary to the French minister, and great treasurer of the marine; and yon promised, that Mr. Wildman's bills for the money he should lay out on these articles should be paid at sight. Mr. Wildman executed your commission with the zeal of a friend, and chose to delay receiving his money till some months after, when he was himself to pass through Paris. In September, 1767, he waited on you at Paris: he hoped he had executed your commission to your satisfaction: you denied that the articles had ever been received. He asked what he must do; and whether, if any accident had happened, it must be his loss? You replied, that he must call upon Mons. Sainte Foy.
Mr. Wildman then desired you to let hint have my clothes, which I had left with you at Paris; because I should not leave England so soon as I had before intended, and when I did go abroad, should not take the route of Paris: you endeavoured to dissuade him from charging himself with the clothes, because of the great rigor of our custom-house; and when you could not deter him, you promised he should have them soon. Mr. Wildman went to Mons. Sainte Foy, was admitted, and told him the cause of his visit; Mons. Sainte Foy pretended that he could not understand either his French or his English: Mr. Wildman went down stairs to call his valet-de-place, who understood both languages well: when he would have gone into the room again to Mons.Sainte Foy, his valet-dechambre said � ' Sir, my master is not at home.' In vain Mr.Wildman insisted, he had quitted his master but that minute to call in his interpreter; the servant persisted that � 'his master was not at home,' and Mr. Wildman could only procure a repetition of the same answer. Mr. Wildman returned to Mr. Wilkes's house; Mr. Wilkes was 'not at home.' He repeated his visits � 'Mr. Wilkes was not at home.' At length he was informed that Mr. Wilkes was gone to his house in the country: Mr. Wildman went thither after you; and you promised to come to Paris the next day and settle all matters, Mr. Wildman returned to Paris with a Mons. Goy, a name well known in England and in France, and a constant companion of Mr. Wilkes. Mons. Goy told Mr. Wildman, 'he might as well save himself the trouble of his visits, he would get neither money nor clothes; for that Mr. Wilkes was exceedingly distressed, and had been forced lately to pawn the clothes.' The next day a note was left at Mr. Wildman's hotel with Mr. Wilkes's name. Mr. Wildman, immediately on the receipt of it, at noon, went to Mr. Wilkes's lodgings. The servants said, Mr. Wilkes was in the country.
Mr. Wildman then went to Messrs. Foley and Panchaud, the bankers, and not finding ' any money left there for him, as you had by letter promised him there should be, he perceived that Mr. Goy had told him truth, and that he was tricked and laughed at, and there- fore instantly quitted Paris. � Such was the return which you, his 'affectionate friend, made to my brother, your hospitable friend, for 'obligations which made it impossible for you to express the feelings of your gratitude,' and for 'favours received under his roof�, of which you promised an eternal remembrance. Mr. Wildman has since made the proper inquiries, and finds that the goods he was commissioned by you to procure were duly delivered.
For my own part I never made the least inquiry after my clothes, but have received a letter within the last three months from Mr. Pantchaud, informing me that they have long been in his possession. Though the extreme meanness of thus filching what you might have received freely as a gift, inspired me with infinite contempt for the very name of Mr. Wilkes, yet compassion for the wretchedness of your situation took away from me all kind of resentment; and though I was determined never to be connected with the man, I was ready to lay down my life in the Cause.
I have mentioned these circumstances not as any charges against you, though no doubt they will operate as such; but merely to prove by facts what was from the beginning the nature of my intercourse with you, and what must have been my motives at the time of its commencement.

TO MR. JOHN WILKES.
SIR,
DURING the city election many worthy merchants having generously come forward to your assistance, and some of them being men of the most rigid morality, you thought it proper to adopt the language of a penitent: to the one you talked of 'Saul transformed into St. Paul;' to another you were more poetical, and told him, that 'hitherto your life must be considered as only bearing the blossoms, and that the public might now expect from you the fruits:' and you talked of the Jollies of your youth, as if you had not been at that time between forty and fifty, and as if folly was all that could be alledged against you. I believe you did not impose upon many; the greater part despised the hypocrite, who before abhorred the rogue: but, however some might be deceived, your conduct did not suffer me, even for a few days, to suppose you a changeling.
On Tuesday morning, March 22, 1768, I paid you the first visit in London. On Wednesday I inserted two advertisements levelled at the old members for Middlesex: for one of which the imprudent hastiness of sir J. Gibbons made that gentleman afterwards publish my name. On Thursday, you set out with me to canvass the western part of the county. Returning in the evening to Brentford, I found there Mr. T n, whose name I did not then know: he had been appointed by your committee of the city to secure some houses at Brentford for the day of the election: he could get none, because he was totally unknown: he applied to me, and appointed me to meet him, on Saturday evening, at the King's Arms, where the committee would settle every thing with me relative to the houses.
On Friday, I procured two inns for the purpose; and engaged myself to them to pay the expenses which should be incurred; and this was necessary, because, if you had lost your election, the people could easily foresee you would again have fled the country, and they would have lost their money.
On Saturday, in the evening, I waited on the committee: Mr. T n was absent: I told them my business, and desired only that the risk of the uncertain expenses at Brentford, on the day of election, might be understood to be equal between us, because I was not suflicient to bear the whole, and such a loss might undo me. They were perfect strangers to me; the committee was distracted with variety of business; all was confusion; and they treated me very cavalierly, as they would have done a sharper who was come to impose upon them by false pretences: the chairman, Mr. J. J , a gentle man of character and a man of business, and not having (as he has since informed me) been acquainted with the circumstances, and knowing that Mr.Tn had been appointed to look after the houses, very properly, though abruptly, bade me quit the room; saying, 'Since houses are- procured, that is sufficient for us, and we have nothing to do with you or your engagements.'
I quitted the room; first telling them, that they were mistaken in supposing they had the houses safe, and therefore might leave me bear the burthen; that I was not quite so foolish as they seemed to imagine; if they would not make it a joint risk, I was still able to save myself; for that I very well knew sir William Beauchamp Proctor and Mr. Cooke would be very glad to take the houses off my hands, and to acknowledge the obligation.
You had hitherto sat silent; but being alarmed at my last words, which I threw out to alarm them, and to make them join with me in the risk, you followed me, and led me, together with Mr. �, into another room; you caught me by the hands, and supplicated me most earnestly not to be offended at such 'creatures' as your committee; you swore I should run no hazard; that you had more than money enough at your bankers, and, would that moment give me a draft for fifteen hundred pounds.
I replied, 'Sir, I was not at all offended before, but I am now: I see you think me a dupe; because it is Saturday evening, and your election comes on Monday morning, you offer me a draft on your banker for fifteen hundred pounds, when I know you have not fifteen pence in the world. It is you that treat
me ill, not they. I am not duped, sir; and I desire I may at least have the honour of doing what I do with my eyes open. Go back and look after them; give yourself no concern about me: I shall act in the same manner as if they had engaged with me. The die is cast: if I had not thought that all was at stake, on the success of your election, I should not have come forward at all; and, having once begun it, nothing shall stop me.'
The success of the election is known: the gentlemen afterwards excused themselves to me for a behaviour for which their good intention entirely justified them; and the committee paid the expenses.
JOHN HORNE.
TO MR. JOHN WILKES.
SIR,
THOUGH I do not intend that you shall artfully draw me off from my course of a regular explanation, yet I think it proper to take some notice of the two letters you have given by way of reply.
And, first, I must observe what you have not done in your letters. You have not even pretended any reason for my dissatisfaction with your conduct. You have not denied that our acquaintance began in the manner and at the time I have mentioned. You acknowledge that you received my letter from Montpelier; and yet you have not denied that you disowned to me the receipt of it. You have not denied
the showing about this letter with an intention to intimidate and injure me; but as Caesar's and De Retz's examples are to justify your dishonest debts, so Cicero's letters, it seems, are to justify your treachery. You have admitted, that I had no communication with you from May, 1767, till March, 1768, and that my first visit to you in London was when you had evidently lost your city election; and yet you have offered no reason why our acquaintance should be in this manner broken off as soon as it was begun, and why, after that interruption, it should be resumed again just at that critical time. You have not imputed to me any motives of action, either when I commenced or when I quitted my intercourse with you, either when I have approved or when I have disapproved your conduct.
Instead of giving a consistent, probable account of any thing, let us now see what you have done. In your first letter you have declared me to be 'the least moral and the least conscientious of men; that my life has passed in a constant and direct opposition to the purity and precepts of the gospel; and that my creed, from the first article to the last of it, is known to be, non credo, &c. � Such charges as these from the mouth of Mr. Wilkes! � But I should be ridiculous if I paid any regard to general abuse: it is sufficient for me to answer, that, were my character so bad as you say, it must be very notorious indeed, and you would not be forced to deal in generals, and, instead of my actions, to accuse the secret thoughts of my heart, which no man can scrutinize; because, since I was eight years old, my whole life has passed before hundreds of witnesses, and you would easily be able to collect all the particulars of my misbehaviour from my infancy. Westminster � Eton � Cambridge � the Temple � my living at Brentford, which I have had upwards of ten years � travelling with the sons of two gentlemen who live within a mile of my house, who applied to me, and to whom I had no recommendation but that notorious character you speak of � all these are not situations in which a man's very bad conduct is likely to be concealed. To general charges, such general answers only can be given.
From my letter you evidently borrowed the thought and the quotation from Horace which you have used in your letter of last Monday; but, unfortunately, you do not understand the passage, an accident that happens very frequently to plagiaries: you say, 'this is all I know of the vestimenta pretiosa of Eutrapelus. I hope, sir, the putting them on will not have the same effect on yon as, formerly, on him.' �If they have no more effect on me, than Horace supposes them to have had formerly on Eutrapelas, they will not do me much mischief: �  The fact is, sir, (as any school-boy can tell you,) that Eutrapelus did not wear the clothes himself, as you suppose, but left them with a profligate at Paris; and the bad effects enumerated by Horace, in the following lines, relate to the fellow who pawned them, and not to Eutrapelus, who gave him the opportunity.
You have made another extract from a letter, you call it, which I sent to you at Fulham. I desire you would give the whole of that letter, and the extract will, then, I believe, have a very different appearance. It is true, that note to you at Fulham had escaped my memory, but I now well recollect the occasion of it. Mr. B, of Fulham, who had been exceedingly useful in your election, came to solicit me, last May, that I would write to you in behalf of some tradesmen there, who had voted for you, or otherwise served you in your election. It was much against my will to tell him my thoughts of his request; and yet I could not be so unjust as to conceal my opinion, and do them an injury under the appearance of a favour. I asked him, smiling, � for you know I cannot laugh � if he really thought such a recommendation of them would be doing them a favour? He replied, they would think it so. I told him, I would not pretend to answer for their being paid; and that I should be sorry to make them such a return for their good public spirit, as to recommend them to a bad private debt. He said, they would use their prudence; which I begged he would caution them to do, that I might not hereafter be reproached. On this occasion, I recollect, I did write you a short note, of which I have, likewise, a copy somewhere; and I remember, too, the substance of it � I expressed to you my surprise, that your credit was so good, and that there were still to be found any persons willing to trust you. The line of my note, which you have extracted, was inserted by me to let you understand that you were not conferring an obligation on me, but that it was an act of friendship in me, towards you, to let you know your friends.
Sir, my surprise to find any tradesmen willing to trust you was the greater, because I knew several of the fraudulent pretences you had used since your enlargement from the King's Bench, to obtain goods from tradesmen. What you say concerning Mr. Onslow's letters is not true; but it needs no refutation, being nothing to the present purpose, and bearing evident marks of falshood on the face of it; for who can be so gross as to believe, that � 'It was printed without your consent from a copy you suffered me to take,' and this, too, after acknowledging that you minted the first letter yourself?
John Horne.
TO MR. JOHN WILKES. 
Do you mean the fidelity you exemplify by publishing private letters or the exactness with which you discharge your obligations? Is there either fidelity or exactness in what you say a few lines afterwards? Not recollect a circumstance of this kind at the distance of two days? you are very exact, truly! The mistake itself is but a trifling one, and such as you have always been very apt to make, only a difference of meum and tuunt; and whether the bad character, given by Horace, relates to you or to me.
And here, sir, I will take the liberty to give you some advice, which may be useful to you; and, to recommend it, I will convey it in the form most pleasing to you � a quotation. � I perceive you do not choose to confess having received the pension from some part of the Rockingham administration; but instead of it, give us a letter to Mr. Onslow on the 12th of December, 1765. The word precarious, in that letter, is a very ugly reason for a patriot to give against accepting a pension, which was offered to him in order to keep him quiet abroad: but what shall we say if he afterwards received the money? I EXPECT you to give a clear, unequivocal answer on the subject; remembering always the above quotation. Why do you say nothing of the other extract from my letter about the expectations you had formed of being sent ambassador to Constantinople, a short time before your letter against the duke of Grafton was published?
The extracts you have meanly made from my letter, had not the least relation to any thing in discussion; you gave them merely to injure me in my profession: it was needless. I gave up all hopes of preferment from the moment I first embarked in the public cause. I did then determine to be as prudent as I could; but, if it was necessary, to sacrifice all that I could call my own: I continue in the same resolution; and when I shall have spent the last farthing, I will retire and earn my bread before I eat it: and, carrying with me my own approbation, I shall not blush when my elbow comes through my coat; nay, should I even be reduced to the state of our first parents, I should, like them, be naked without being ashamed.
John Horne.
TO MR. JOHN W1LKES.
MR. COTES and Mr. Reynolds seem to declare upon their honour with as little scruple as Jews swear on the New Testament. Alas! the policies will enrich the one no more than the town-clerkship the other, You say (as you did before) that you did not approve your brother's attempt; although, not approving it, he shall have your vote. You said so, it is true; but I did not believe the truth of what you said. Your brother used the argument of your approbation very strongly to me as well as to others. I know that, like you, he has since chosen to deny it.
Unfortunately for you both, sir, he has made a written application. He applied to me on the first of August. On the fourth, I wrote him an answer. On the sixth, he wrote to Mr. Bellas, addressed to him at Farnham, in Surrey, testifying his brother's assent.
Now, sir, what subterfuge? Did you approve, or did you not? If you did not approve, what credit can for the future be given to your brother? And whose testimony will you employ to prove that you were not to have a share in the office? You are very discreet when you refuse to 'accept any place in the city.' The disposal of all would be much more lucrative to you than the possession of one; and if, instead of a share, your candidates were all able, like Mr. Reynolds, to advance the price of the office, your gain would be less precarious.
Will you content yourself, as you have hitherto done, to deny all, and leave it on your own bare authority? I believe you will; for I know that you cannot defend yourself a moment, without being driven to an impudent, manifest contradiction of the most consistent circumstances; the best attested truths; the most notorious facts; and the clear testimony of some of the most respectable public men in the world; I mean Mr. Oliver, Mr. Townsend, Mr. Sawbridge, Mr. Glynn, sir Robert Bernard, Mr. Bellas, Mr. Lovell, &c. &c.
These, with a great number of other gentlemen of considerable character in private stations, have been witnesses to the whole of my conduct; to them I shall be forced frequently to appeal, and, with the most perfect confidence, I trust my character to their affirmations; against the declarations, upon honour, of such men as Mr. Reynolds and Mr.Humphry Cotes.
JOHN HORNE.
TO MR. WILKES.
INJURIES for benefits is the ancient commerce of mankind. It is not a new branch discovered by Mr. Wilkes, though he certainly carries it on in a manner much more extensive than usual. After signing your name to a declaration, that Mr. Oliver your generous benefactor) refused to do you justice, I cannot wonder you should make your attorney say, that the balance of private favours between him and me is on his side. I never received any one favour, either from you or Mr. Reynolds in my life. You formerly accused me anonymously of having collected various subscriptions, and converted them to my own purposes; amongst others, you mentioned the subscription for the appeal of the widow Bigby. You did not do this with any hopes of fixing such an imputation upon me; you had a more malevolent design; and with the same view you now make Mr. Reynolds say, (without the least relation to any thing in question, and in contradiction to your former charge of concealment,) that he, this man of spotless honour, accompanied me to several gentlemen's houses in Westminster, for subscriptions for the widow Bigby. No doubt, sir, there is a fine set of murderers let loose, whom I have endeavoured to bring to justice, � lo Mio and Aria ; � and you, like the infernal magician, by pointing out their prosecutor, have tacked them to my tail, and bid them � stick close, boys.
But neither this nor the other gross abuse, with which yon daily fill the papers, shall take from, me my temper, nor divert me from my purpose. I do not desire to make myself greater or you less, I desire only to prevent mischief. I ask not the confidence of the public, nor am I in a situation to abuse it: my good or bad character, (though it is far out of your reach,) can only benefit or hurt myself; to them it is a matter perfectly indifferent. Not so with you. You are a public man; and it is necessary for their safety, that they should be told, since nothing can restrain you, to what precipices you would lead them, and into what destruction, disgrace, and ridicule, you would plunge them, It is not by recrimination, but by defence, that you can ever be able to gain their implicit confidence: it is not by telling them, that I am an atheist, but by justifying the aim and object of your political pursuits, that you must expect their support. The utmost you can obtain by your method of recrimination is, to have the public say, Wilkes and Home are both rogues alike, and it is difficult to determine which is the greater. The idle, the careless, and the incapable, are sure to make this decision; because it saves the two first from the trouble of inquiry, and the last cannot form a judgment: to these are joined the whole ministerial and selfish tribe, whose favourite maxim, and whose real belief it has always been, that all men are rogues alike, and that patriots of all professions are the same.
These general decisions are very convenient to cover ignorance and palliate knavery. How absurd! that, whilst they allow a difference in degree of all other virtues and vices; whilst they are forced to acknowledge that all men and women are not equally chaste or lustful, sober or drunken, prudent or prodigal, &c., they should yet contend that all are equally mercenary! Though these men do not compose the whole of mankind, they make up a very considerable part; and your method of controversy has entirely forfeited their assistance, Men of reflection, integrity, and discernment, are disgusted at the grossness of your abuse, and perceive guilt to be the cause of your shuffling evasions: not that I believe you would be sorry at their removal from you, if it were not that you are sensible �'the fleece accompanies the flock.' The natural consequence of your behaviour is, that you are at this moment reduced to a little faction of about forty very inconsiderable names; many of them honest, mistaken, or uninformed simpletons; some of them jovial fellows, who look no further than the laugh and merriment of the table, and some of them disappointed or interested knaves. To each of these, in his turn, you confidentially declare how much you despise the rest; and should every man to whom you have made such a declaration, quit your acquaintance, you would not have one fool left whom you could flatter with the abuse of another; and if your present adherents will only compare notes together, they will easily learn your opinion of them all.
But to proceed � Having now established Mr. Heaton Wilkes the declared, advertising candidate for the chamberlainship of the city of London; and secured to him your public-spirited vote, though you disapprove his at- tempt; I will, in my next, begin to show your conduct to the public society at the London Tavern.
John Horne.
