How then is the slave-holder to secure what he esteems his property? Perhaps he will endeavor clandestinely to seize the supposed slave in order to transport him, (with or without his consent) to the colonies, where such property is allowed: But let him take care what he does, the very attempt is punishable, and even the making over his property to another for that purpose, renders him equally liable to the severe penalties of the law, for a bill of sale may certainly be included under the terms expressed in the Habeas Corpus act. It is also dangerous for a counsellor or any other person to advise (see the act �shall be advising�) such proceedings by saying. Likewise an Attorney, Notary-public, or any other person, who shall presume to draw up, negotiate, or even to witness a bill of sale, or other instrument, for such commitment, &c. offends equally against the law, because are liable to all the penalties of the act. So that the injured may have ample satisfaction for their sufferings; and even a judge contrary to this statute whatever his private opinion may be concerning property in slaves; because, no order or command, nor injunction, is allowed to interfere with this golden act of liberty.
I have before observed, that the general term, �every Alien,� includes all strangers whatsoever, and renders them subject to the King and the laws during their residence in this kingdom; and this is certainly true, whether the aliens be Turks, Moors, Arabians, Tartars, or even savages from any part of the world. � Men are rendered obnoxious to the laws by their offences, and not by the particular denomination of their rank, order, parentage, colour or country, and therefore, though we should suppose that any particular body of people whatsoever were not known, or had in consideration by the legislature at the different times when the severe penal laws were made, yet no man can reasonably conceive, that such men are exempted on this account from the penalties of the said laws, when legally convicted of having offended against them.
Laws calculated for the moral purpose of preventing oppression, are likewise usually supposed to be everlasting, and to make up a part of our happy constitution; for which reason, though the kind of oppression to be guarded against, and the penalties for offenders are minutely described therein, yet the persons to be protected are comprehended in terms as general as possible; that may seem to be excluded from protection. The general terms of the several statutes before cited are so full and clear, that they admit of no exception whatsoever, for all person, (Negroes as well as others) must be included in the terms. Also, every man may be free to sue, &c., and no man, of what estate or condition than he be, shall be taken nor imprisoned. &c. True justice makes no respect of persons, and can never deny to any one that blessing to which all mankind have an undoubted right, their natural liberty: Though the law makes no mention of Negroe slaves, yet this is no just argument for excluding them from the general protection of our happy constitution.
Neither can the objection, that Negroe slaves were not �had in consideration or contemplation� when these laws were made, prove any thing against them; but, on the contrary, much in their favour; for both these circumstances are strong presumptive proofs, that the practice of importing slaves into this kingdom, and retaining them as such, is an innovation entirely foreign to the spirit and intention of the laws now in force.
A toleration of slavery, is, in effect, a toleration of inhumanity; for there are wretches in the world, who make no scruple to gain, by wearing out their slaves with continual labour, and a scanty allowance, before they have lived out half their natural days. �Tis notorious, that this is too often the case in the unhappy countries where slavery is tolerated.
See the account of the European settlements in America, Part VI. Chap. 11. Concerning the �misery of the Negroes, great waste of them. which informs us, not only of a most scandalous profanation of the Lord�s day, but also, of another abomination, which must be infinitely more heinous in the fight of God, viz. oppression carried to such excess, as to be even destructive of the human species.
At present the inhumanity of constrained labour in excess, extends no farther in England, than to our beasts, as post and hackney horses, sand asses, &c.
But thanks to our laws, and not to the general good disposition of masters, that it is so, for the wretch, who is bad enough to mal-treat a helpless beast, would not spare his fellow man, if he had him as much in his power.
The maintenance of civil liberty, is therefore, absolutely necessary to prevent an increase of our national guilt, by the addition of the horrid crime of tyranny. - Notwithstanding that the plea of necessity cannot here be urged, yet this is no reason why an increase of the practice is not to be feared.
Our North America colonies afford us a melancholy instance to the contrary; -for though the climate in general is so wholesome and temperate, that it will not authorize this pleas of necessity for the employment of slaves, any more than our own, yet the pernicious practice of slave-holding is become almost general in those parts. At New York, for instance, the infringement on civil or domestic liberty is become notorious, notwithstanding the political controversies of the inhabitants in praise of liberty; but no panegyrick on this subject (however elegant in itself) can be graceful, or edifying from the mouth, or pen of one of those provincials; because men, who do not scruple to detain others in slavery, have but a very partial and unjust claim to the protection of the laws of liberty; and indeed it too plainly appears, that they have no real regard for liberty, farther than their own private interests are concerned; and (consequently) that they have so little detestation for despotism and tyranny, that they do not scruple to exercise them whenever their caprice excites them, or their private interest seems to require an exertion of their power over their miserable slaves.
Every petty planter, who avails himself of the service of slaves, is an arbitrary monarch, or rather a lawless Bashaw in his own territories, notwithstanding that the imaginary freedom of the province wherein he resides, may seem to forbid the observation.
The boasted liberty of our American colonies, therefore, has so little right to that sacred name, that it seems to differ from the arbitrary power of despotic monarchs, only in one circumstance, viz. that it is a many-headed monster of tyranny, which entirely subverts our most excellent constitution, because liberty and slavery are so opposite to each other, that they cannot subsist in the same community. This observation of the learned Montesquieu, I hope, sufficiently justifies my censure of the Americans for their notorious violation of civil liberty. �The New-York Journal, or, The General Advertiser, for Thursday, 22d October 1767, Gives Notice by Advertisement of no less than eight different persons who have escaped from slavery, or are put up to public sale for that horrid purpose.
That I may demonstrate the indecency of such proceedings in a free country, I shall take the liberty of laying some of these Advertisements before my readers, by way of example. 
Here is not the least consideration or scruple of conscience for the inhumanity of parting the mother and young child. From the stile, one would suppose the Advertisement to be of no more importance than if it related merely to the sale of a cow and her calf, and that the cow should be sold with or without her calf according as the purchaser should require. �But not only Negroes, but even American Indians are detained in the same abominable slavery in our colonies, though there cannot be any reasonable pretence whatsoever, for holding one of these as private property; for even, if a written contract should be produced as a voucher in such a case, there would still remain great suspicion, that some undue advantage had been taken of the Indians ignorance concerning the nature of such a bond.
Upon the whole, I think, I may, with justice conclude, that those Advertisements discover a shameless prostitution and infringement on the common and natural rights of mankind. �But hold! Perhaps the Americans may be able, with too much justice, to retort this severe reflection, an may refer us to news-papers published even in the free city of London, which contain Advertisements, not less dishonourable than their own. See Advertisement in the Public Ledger of 31st December, 1761.
Another Advertisement, not long ago, offered a reward for stopping a female slave who had left her mistress in Hatton-garden. And in the Gazetteer of 18th April 1769, appeared a very extraordinary Advertisement, with the following title.
Another Advertisement in the same paper, contains a very particular description of a Negroe man, called Jeremiah - It is not on account of shame, that men, who are capable of undertaking the desperate and wicked employment of kidnappers, are supposed to be tempted to such a business, by a promise, �of the utmost secrecy.� But this must be from a sense of the unlawfulness of the act proposed to them, that they may have less reason to fear a prosecution. And as such a kind of people are supposed to undertake any thing for money, the Reward of thirty Guineas was tendered at the top of the Advertisement in capital letters. No man can be safe, be he white or black, if temptations to break the laws are so shamefully published in our news-papers.
A Creole Black Boy, is also offered to sale in the Daily Advertiser of the same date.
Besides these instances, the Americans may perhaps taunt us with the shameful treatment of a poor Negroe servant, who not long ago was put up to sale by public auction, together with the effects of his bankrupt master. �Also, that the prisons of this free city have been frequently prostituted of late by the tyrannical and dangerous practice of confining Negroes, under the pretence of slavery, though there has been no warrants whatsoever for their commitment.
This circumstance of confining a man without a warrant, has so great a resemblance to the proceedings of a Popish inquisition, that it is but too obvious what dangerous practices such scandalous innovations (if permitted to grow more into use) are liable to introduce. No person can be safe, if wicked and designing men have it in their power, under the pretence of a private property as a slave, to throw a man clandestinely without a warrant into goal, and to conceal him there, until they can conveniently dispose of him.
A free man may be thus robbed of his liberty, and carried beyond the seas, without having the least opportunity of making his caf� known; which should teach us how jealous we ought to be of all imprisonments made without the authority, or previous examination of a civil magistrate.
The distinction of colour will, in a short time, be no protection against such outrages, especially, as not only Negroes, but Mullatoes, and even American Indians, (which appears by one of the Advertisements before quoted) are retained in slavery in our American colonies; for there are many honest weather-beaten Englishmen, who have as little reason to boast of their complexion as the Indians. And indeed the more northern Indians, have no difference from us in complexion, but such as is occasioned by the climate or different way of living. The plea of private property, therefore, cannot by any means justify a private commitment of any person whatsoever to prison, because of the apparent danger and tendency of such an innovation. This dangerous practice of concealing in prison, was attempted in the case of Jonathan Strong; for the door-keeper of the P (or some person who acted for him) absolutely refused for two days to permit this poor injured Negro to be seen or spoke with, though a person went on purpose both those days to demand the same.
All laws ought to be founded upon the principle of �doing as one would be done by,� and indeed this principle seems to be the very basis of the English constitution, for what precaution could possibly be more effectual for that purpose, than the right we enjoy of being judged by our Peers, creditable persons of the vicinage; especially, as we may likewise claim the right of excepting against any particular juryman, who might be suspected of partiality.
This law breathes the pure spirit of liberty, equity and social love; being calculated to maintain that consideration and mutual regard, which one person ought to have for another howsoever unequal in rank or station.
But when any part of the community, under the pretence of private property, is deprived of this common privilege, �tis a violation of civil liberty, which is entirely inconsistent with the social principles of a free state.
True liberty protects the labourer, as well as his Lord; preserves the dignity of human nature, and seldom fails to render a province rich and populous; whereas, on the other hand, a toleration of slavery is the highest breach of social virtue, and not only tends to depopulation, but too often renders the minds of both masters and slaves utterly depraved and inhuman, by the hateful extremes of exaltation and depression. If such a toleration should ever be generally admitted in England, (which God forbid) we shall no longer deserve to be esteemed a civilized people; because, when the customs of uncivilized nations, and the uncivilized customs which disgrace our own colonies, are become so familiar, as to be permitted amongst us with impunity, we ourselves must insensibly degenerate to the same degree of baseness with those from whom such bad customs were derived, and may too soon have the mortification to see the hateful extremes of tyranny and slavery fostered under every roof.
Then must the happy medium of a well regulated liberty be necessarily compelled to find shelter in some more civilized country, where social virtue, and that divine precept, �Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,� are better understood.
An attempt to prove the dangerous tendency, injustice and disgrace of tolerating slavery amongst Englishmen, would in any former age have been esteemed as superfluous and ridiculous, as if a man should undertake in a formal manner to prove, that darkness is not light.
Sorry am I, that the depravity of the present age has made a demonstration of this kind necessary.
Now that I may sum up the amount of what has been said in a single sentence, I shall beg leave to conclude in the words of the great sir Edward Coke, which though spoken on a different, occasion, are yet applicable to this, see Rushworth�s Hist.
According to the laws of Jamaica printed at London in 1756. Now that I may inform my readers what corporal punishments are sometimes thought fit to be inflicted, I will refer to the testimony of sir Hans Sloan, (see voyage to the islands of Madeira, Barbadoes, &c. and Jamaica, with the natural history of the last of these islands, &c. London 1707. Introduction, p. 56, and 57.) Thus sir Hans Sloan endeavours to excuse those shocking cruelties, but certainly in vain: because no crimes whatsoever can merit such severe punishments, unless I except the crimes of those who devise and inflict them. Sir Hans Sloan indeed, mentions rebellion, as the principal crime, and certainly it is very justly esteemed a most heinous crime, in a land of liberty, where government is limited by equitable and just laws, if the same are tolerably well observed; but in countries where arbitrary power is exercised with such intolerable cruelty, as is before described, if resistance be a crime, it is certainly the most natural of all others.
But the 19th clause of the 38th act, would indeed on a flight perusal induce us to conceive, that the punishment for rebellion is not so severe as it is represented by sir Hans Sloan; because a slave, though deemed rebellious, is thereby condemned to no greater punishment than transportation. Nevertheless if the clause be thoroughly considered we shall find no reason to commend the mercy of the legislature; for it only proves, that the Jamaica law-makers will not scruple to charge the slightest and most natural offences with the most opprobrious epithets; and that a poor slave who perhaps has no otherwise incurred his master�s displeasure than by endeavouring (upon the just and warrantable principles of self-preservation) to escape from his master�s tyranny, without any criminal intention whatsoever, is liable to be deemed rebellious, and to be arraigned as a capital offender. Thus we are enabled to define what a West Indian tyrant means by the word rebellious. But unjust as this clause may seem, yet it is abundantly more merciful and considerate than a subsequent act against the same poor miserable people, because the former assigns no other punishment for persons so deemed rebellious than that they.
Thus it is manifest, that the law treats these poor unhappy men with as little ceremony and consideration, as if they were merely wild beasts. But the innocent blood that is shed in consequence of such a detestable law, must certainly call for vengeance on the murderous abettors and actors of such deliberate wickedness: And though many of the guilty wretches should even be so hardened and abandoned as never afterwards to be capable of sincere remorse, yet a time will undoubtedly come, when they will shudder with dreadful apprehensions, on account of the insufficiency of so wretched an excuse, as that their poor murdered brethren were by law, �deemed rebellious.� But bad as these laws are, yet, in justice to the freeholders of Jamaica, I must acknowledge, that their laws are not near so cruel and inhuman as the laws of Barbadoes and Virginia, and seem at present, to be much more reasonable than they have formerly been, many very oppressive laws being now expired, and others less severe enacted in their room. 
But it is far otherwise in Barbadoes; for by the 329th act, p. 125. � Now the reader, to be sure, will naturally expect, that some very severe punishment must in this case be ordained, to deter, the wanton, bloody minded, and cruel wretch from willfully killing his fellow creatures; but alas! the Barbadian law-makers have been so far from intending to curb such abandoned wickedness, that they have absolutely made this law on purpose to screen these enormous crimes from the just indignation of any righteous person, who might think himself bound in duty to prosecute a bloody minded villain; they have, therefore, presumptuously taken upon them to give a sanction, as it were, by law, to the horrid crime of willful murder; and have accordingly ordained, that he who is guilty of it in Barbadoes, though the act should be attended with all the aggravating circumstances before mentioned, �shall pay into the publick treasury (no more than) fifteen pounds sterling;� but if he shall kill another man�s, he shall pay to the owner of the Negro, double the value, and into the public treasury, twenty five pounds sterling, and he shall further, by the next justice of the peace, be bound to his good behavior, during the pleasure of the governor and council, and not be liable to any other punishment or forfeiture for the same. 
The most consummate wickedness, I suppose, that any body of people, under the specious form of a legislature were ever guilty of: This act contains several other clauses which are shocking to humanity, though, too tedious to mention here.
And left private interest should incline the planter to mercy, (to which we must suppose such people can have no other inducement) it is provided and enacted in the succeeding clause, (No. 38.) 
I have already given examples enough of the horrid cruelties which are sometimes thought fit on such occasions. But if the innocent and most natural act of �running away,� from intolerable tyranny deserves such relentless severity, what kind of punishment have these law-makers themselves to expect hereafter, on account of their own enormous offences; alas! to look for mercy (without a timely repentance) will only be another instance of their gross injustice! �Having their consciences seared with a hot iron,� they seem to have lost all apprehensions that their slaves are men, for they scruple not to number them with beasts. See an act of Barbadoes.
Now let us consider the dangerous tendency of those laws. As Englishmen, we strenuously contend for this absolute and immutable necessity of trials by juries: but it not the spirit and equity of this old English doctrine entirely lost, if we partially confine that justice to ourselves alone, when we have it in our power to extend it to others? The natural right of all mankind must principally justify our insisting upon this necessary privilege in favour of ourselves in particular, and therefore if we do not allow that the judgement of an impartial jury is indispensably necessary in all cases whatsoever, wherein the life of man is depending, we certainly undermine the equitable force and reason of those laws, by which we ourselves are protected, and consequently are unworthy to be esteemed, either Christians or Englishmen.
Whatever right the members of a provincial assembly may have to enact bye laws, for particular exigences among themselves yet in so doing, they are certainly bound in duty to their sovereign, to observe most strictly, the fundamental principles of that constitution, which his majesty is sworn to maintain; for wheresoever the bounds of the British empire are extended, there the common law of England must of course take place, and cannot be safely set aside by any private law whatsoever, because the introduction of an unnatural tyranny must necessarily endanger the king�s dominions. The many alarming insurrections of slaves in the several colonies, are sufficient proofs of this. The common law of England ought therefore to be so established in every province, as to include the respective bye laws of each province; instead of being by them excluded which latter has been too much the case.
Every inhabitant of the British colonies, black as well as white, bond as well as free, are undoubtedly the king�s subjects, during their residence within the limits of the king�s dominions, and as such, are entitled to personal protection, however bound in service to their respective masters. Therefore, when any of these are put to death, �without the solemnity of a jury,� I fear that there is too much reason to attribute the guilt of murder, to every person concerned in ordering the same, or in consenting thereto; and all such persons are certainly responsible to the king and his laws, for the loss of a subject. The horrid iniquity, injustice, and dangerous tendency of the several plantation laws, which I have treated them. If such laws are not absolutely necessary for the government of slaves, the law-makers must unavoidably allow themselves to be the most cruel and abandoned tyrants upon earth, or perhaps, that ever were on earth. On the other hand. Of it be said, that it is impossible to govern slaves without such inhuman severity and detestable injustice, the same will certainly be an invincible argument against the least toleration of slavery amongst Christians, because the temporal profit of the planter or master, however lucrative, cannot compensate the forfeiture of his everlasting welfare, or (at least I may be allowed to say) the apparent danger of such a forfeiture.
Oppression is a most grievous crime; and the cries of these much injured people (though they are only poor ignorant heathens) will certainly reach heaven! The scriptures (which are the only true foundation of all laws) denounce a tremendous judgement against the man who should offend even one little one;
Who then shall attempt to vindicate those inhuman establishments of government, under which, even our own countrymen so grievously offend and oppress, (not merely one, or a few little ones, but) an immense multitude of men, women, children, and the children of their children, from generation to generation? May it not be said with like justice, it were better for the English nation that these American dominions had never existed, or even that they should have been sunk into the sea, than that the kingdom of Great-Britain should be loaded with the horrid guilt of tolerating such adominable wickedness! In short, if the king�s prerogative is not speedily exerted for the relief of his majesty�s oppressed and much injured subjects in the British colonies (because to relieve the subject from the oppression of petty tyrants, is the principal use of the royal prerogative, as well as the principal and most natural means of maintaining the same) and for the extension of the British constitution to the most distant colonies whether in the East or West Indies, it must inevitably be allowed, that great share of this enormous guilt will certainly rest on this side of the water.
I hope this hint will be taken notice of by those whom it may concern; and that the freedom of it will be excused, as from a loyal and disinterested adviser.
