From what has been said, it must appear, that Conscience, Reason, and Sinderesis, though sometimes treated as distinct Principles, are nevertheless essentially founded on one Great Principle, viz. the Divine Knowledge of GOOD and EVIL; and when our first parents, contrary to the commands of God, took that Knowledge upon themselves, the immediate effects of it were the most pungent workings of Conscience! They were conscious of their disobedience to God! Conscious of their shame and nakedness! Conscious that the Divine Justice must pursue them, so that they would have even hid themselves, had it been possible. From the presence of their Almighty Creator! But how vain was the attempt to fly from God�s universal presence, when they could not even separate themselves from the anxious warnings and forebodings even of their own Consciences! For Conscience maintained its new habitation in their throbbing breasts, attending them in their most secret retirement with a stinging remembrance of their disobedience and ingratitude! And as the willful taking of Conscience upon themselves was the cause of all their misery; so the effect of that one fault was the entailing Sin and Death on all their descendants (who by the Laws of Nature must, necessarily, partake of that Nature which their parents so unhappily assumed) for thus-�by one Man Sin entered into the world� (as we are informed by the great Apostle of the Gentiles) �and Death by Sin; and so Death passed upon all Men� in or through whom �all have sinned.� For until the Law. So we ought to conclude, that some sort of Law, previous to that of Moses, preceded Sin, as Sin preceded Death, viz., for otherwise Death could not have reigned before the written Law; and consequently the Law, to be understood, by which �Sin entered into the world,� and by which �Death passed upon all,� and �reigned from Adam to Moses,� was the Law of internal Knowledge, or Conscience, by which all Men, from the time of our first parents (Christ alone excepted) are convicted Sinners! For as the Ways of Man are not equal to his assumed Knowledge, he is thereby rendered guilty, and obnoxious to the eternal Justice of God, �in whose sight shall no man living be justified!�
Hence a temporal DEATH, or departure from this world, is not the only fruit of Sin, but there is also a &c. the sense of which is so deeply imprinted on the human Conscience, that even the most hardened offender is, at some time or other, affected with it: otherwise Sin could not be esteemed �the Sting of Death�-For if the natural light of Human Reason would permit men to indulge themselves with a positive assurance, that Death is really the last period, or final dissolution of their existence, the Consciousness of Sin would not increase the Fear of Death, and could not, therefore, with propriety be esteemed �the Sting of Death.� Death is, indeed, the King of Terrors; and Nature shrinks at its approach! But the anguish of the guilty and unbelieving soul springs from a deeper source than Death! viz. the dread of what must follow it! This is a further effect of Reason and Human Knowledge: for though a man refuses to be bound by the eternal Laws of Reason, yet Reason will inform him of his guilt, and its deserts, and vindicate her injured Laws by dreadful expectation! for the very Devils believe and tremble!
Horrible gloom! when Reason sees no ground for hope! �Thus Conscience, though not obeyed, is Conscience still; and a time, we know, will surely come, when men shall 
Death, therefore, it is manifest, not the only object of the sinner�s fear, or men would never seek a hiding-place in what must be their graves, by wishing to be buried under the very mountains and hills, with the vain hope of secreting themselves from the wrath to come!
- And who is free from sin? � In the sight of God �shall no man living be justified,� And �without shedding of BLOOD is no remission.� Wherefore it is manifest, that the BLOOD of every man is forfeited before God! � But the Almighty was graciously pleased to accept the BLOOD of animals (probably as an acknowledgment of that forfeiture, and as a type of a future and more effectual redemption) to atone for human guilt � 
But as the Necessity of Redemption is thus obvious, so the means of obtaining it has been as clearly revealed: and therefore the same innate Knowledge of Good and Evil, which has rendered us obnoxious to GOD�s Eternal Justice through disobedience, will lead us (if we use it as we ought) to repentance and amendment; and consequently to reconciliation and eternal happiness, through that more effectual propitiation and redemption, to which all mankind are invited by the Redeemer himself.
Men seldom fall, indeed, into any very gross offence against the Eternal Law, till they are initiated as it were by lesser crimes; and have gradually stifled the natural restraint of the innate Knowledge or Conscience before described; and then they are no longer worthy to be called Men, being more properly Brutes; because Conscience, or the Knowledge of Good and Evil, which should distinguish the Nature of Men from Brutes, doth no longer influence their actions.
The state, indeed, of such unhappy men is worse than that of brutes; because there is still another capital distinction in their nature, which wicked men cannot cast off, as they do Conscience!-they have a living Soul, which must, inevitably, be accountable for all their actions, as I have before remarked; and, therefore, when they prefer the temporal gratification of their passions (whether of Pride, Love of unlimited Power, Avarice, Lust, Hatred, or Selfishness) to the eternal welfare of their souls, they may be said to sell themselves for nought; because all unlawful passions are increased, instead of being satisfied, by indulgence; so that there is no Bondage so wretched as that of Sin; no Slave so truly miserable, as the man who is a Slave to his passions. And, therefore when we, are endeavouring to trace out �the Law of Nature and Principles of Action in Men, � it would be unreasonable to search for it among Slaves (I mean those that are Slaves to their passions) because such MEN are not their own masters, and consequently are not worthy the name of MEN. It would be neither just or charitable to draw our conclusions concerning the Nature of Man from that depraved state of Human Nature, wherein the proper and natural distinction of Manhood (the KNOWLEDGE of GOOD and EVIL, which we naturally inherit from our first parents) has lost its influence!
No MAN, indeed, is perfect; neither are ALL MEN depraved; and though the depraved state of man may, perhaps, be most general, it, certainly, is not universal; and therefore �the universal Principle of Action in Man� is not to be drawn from thence. But it will be still much more profitable for us to remember (when any Rule of Obedience is proposed as an universal Principle of Action) that it is not so much our business or interest to trace out what REALLY IS �the universal Principle of Action,� as what it OUGHT TO BE. I have already produced the testimony of the most learned and able lawyer among the Heathens, that �the Knowledge of Good and Evil� is an universal Principle, natural to mankind; and he so far esteems it as �a Rule of Obedience,� that he lays it down as the foundation of Law. But a modern, though very learned and respectable, law commentator, has referred us to a different Principle, as a �Rule of Obedience,� which is very liable to be misunderstood: he informs us in page 41, vol. 1. That the Creator � Yet, in justice to the worthy author, it must be allowed, that the Happiness, which he speaks of, is not selfish, partial, or sensual Happiness (for that would be a very improper subject for a �paternal Precept�) but �real Happiness,� and �substantial Happiness,� as he further expresses himself in the same page; and no Happiness can be �real,� or �substantial,� which is not lasting; so that it is plain this eminent writer means that lasting �and substantial Happiness� alone, which arises from Obedience to the will of God: for the Knowledge of which he refers us, at the same time, to the Holy Scriptures. 
Yet even such �substantial Happiness� can only be called an effect, of which a conscientious Obedience to the will of God is one of the causes; but the primary cause, or motive, to that Obedience in good Men, is still different from both; and yet not of them can be the proper foundation of Ethics, or natural Law.
The learned author has himself assigned a more probably foundation in the preceding page, to which perhaps he might mean to refer by the pronominal adjective. 
Thus THE FOUNDATION is clearly laid down, and there is no occasion to assign any other Motive of Obedience to the several Laws on this Foundation, than what is mentioned in the same sentence, viz. Human Reason, by which men are enabled to discover �these eternal and immutable Laws of Good and Evil,� For the Knowledge of what is Good, or what is Evil, is surely a sufficient Motive for chusing the one, and rejecting the other; because Good, when known, is as truly amiable in itself, as Evil is detestable and frightful; so that the former most naturally engages our preference, without any other Motive than this natural Knowledge of their respective qualities.
Sinister Motives do, nevertheless, too frequently prevail, through the extreme frailty of Human Nature, which engages the greater part of mankind in the pursuit of temporal Interest, or partial and sensual Happiness!
So that, if the learned commentator had mentioned Self-love, as the general, instead of the �universal Principle of Action,� I should not have thought myself obliged to have taken particular notice of that part of his work.
Several reasons may be assigned why it cannot be admitted as the �universal Principle of Action.�
And, first, Because the most worthy actions, as I have already observed, are frequently occasioned by a more generous motive than Self-love.
Secondly, Because bad men are sometimes prompted to good actions, through the influence of their own natural Knowledge of Good and Evil, when the occasion happens not to interfere with their particular views of private Interest, or their predominant Passions: for, if this was not the case, it is obvious (considering the great multitude of selfish men in comparison of the Just) that society could not exist.
And, thirdly, Because bad actions, which most abound, manifestly tend, even in the opinion of the offenders themselves, to defeat the most essential purposes of Self-love; for the most hardened sinners are conscious, through their innate Knowledge of Good and Evil, that unlawful temporary gratifications tend to deprive them of their �real� and �substantial happiness,� viz. Eternal Salvation; for if they had not this Consciousness of Evil, there could be no such thing as presumptuous sin.
Self-love, however, under proper restrictions, is certainly a main branch of the Law of Nature; and, though it cannot be admitted as the �universal Principle of Action;� is nevertheless an universal Principle; but it cannot be admitted as a �Rule of Obedience,� because there are many occasions when it ought to be superseded by more noble Motives to Action.
The Knowledge of Good and Evil is also an universal Principle in Man; though it is still much farther from being �the universal Principle of Action� than Self-love; and indeed my present attempt is not to prove what is the �universal Principle of Action,� but only what it ought to be, as I before remarked; being convinced, that �the one paternal Precept� laid down by the learned Law Commentator (though certainly with good intentions, and probably with good authority from other Law Writers) as the �Rule of Obedience,� (viz. �that we should pursue our own Happiness�) is very defective; because the very Rule itself requires a multitude of other Rules to restrain it within due bounds, and curb the Self-love of individuals for the benefit of society.
Nothing is so liable to be misunderstood as �our own Happiness;� for when Self alone is the object, Self-love can imply nothing but Partiality and Self-preference; so that such �a Rule of Obedience� is liable to afford a handle of excuse for actions of mere Self-gratification, to which the learned and worthy author (or, perhaps, rather the adopter) of the hypothesis would be entirely averse: a Slaveholder, for instance, might alledge, that he �pursues his own Happiness,� by extorting the unwilling service of other men, because he is thereby enabled to maintain himself and family, not only comfortably, but elegantly; and that the maintenance and support of the sugar islands, and consequently the happiness of his wealthy neighbours, depends upon the employing of slaves; so that social benefits do also arise from it: and he will likewise alledge, that he is obliged by �Self-love� to persist in the measure, because he cannot maintain the same Happiness and comfort by any other means; so that he does not act contrary to �the Law of Nature,� or the �Rule of Obedience,� as laid down by the most eminent writers on the subject!
Thus the �paternal Precept� (as it is called) of pursuing our own Happiness, may lead men to form a false estimate of necessity (or what they may think themselves obliged to undertake, from their particular situation in life) and will afford them the like excuse for any other vice, on which a man�s temporal subsistence depends.
It is therefore an oblique Rule, which insensibly declines into mere Self-gratification, or private Interest, which is the bane of Equity and Justice; so that Self-love can no otherwise be admitted as a Rule, than for the purpose of measuring the due proportion of that Love which we owe to the rest of mankind, agreeable to a real �paternal Precept� that will never deceive us; �Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thyself.�
This excellent maxim of the Old Law is strongly enforced and recommended in the New Testament, which shall hereafter be shown: nay, the very Heathens, it seems, were not entirely ignorant of this Divine Precept; for the favourite maxim of the Emperor Alexander Severus was much to the same effect, according to the report of Lampridius, quoted by the learned Joseph Mede, Viz. Neither has the doctrine been overlooked by the writers on the Law of Nature. Hobbes very judiciously refers us to this Rule of Obedience, �for the easy knowledge of what the Law of Nature dictates.� 
The learned Baron, nevertheless, remarks in the following paragraph-
But howsoever it may be capable of being demonstrated, yet this is no just objection to Hobbes�s excellent rule for knowing,-�what the Law of Nature dictates;� especially as the learned objector seems, afterwards, to have sought in vain for a more �fundamental Axiom of the Law of Nature:� for I cannot find, that anything, he has afterwards proposed, is at all worthy to be compared with it, either as �a Foundation, or a �Rule of Obedience.��
Nevertheless, in justice to the learned Baron, I must observe, that he has well defended this general Rule against the objection of Dr. Sharrock.
Neither does the Baron�s own objection, which immediately follows, in the least affect the propriety of Hobbes�s rule �for the easy Knowledge of what the Law of Nature dictates:� for though the nature of a Rule, or Principle of Doctrine (differing from active Principles) be such as to induce the necessity of supposing a prior Principle, or Instinct in man, whereby he may be enabled to suggest, adopt, approve, obey this or any other Rule, (which seems to be the reason of the Baron�s refusing to acknowledge this excellent rule, as �a fundamental Axiom of the Law of Nature�) yet the learned Baron himself has multiplied the difficulty, by assigning still another Rule, or mere Principle of Doctrine (viz. the holding all Men equal with ourselves) as the foundation of this Rule, instead of a real first Clause, such as the immediate Inspiration of God; the Revelation of his Will in the Scriptures; or the natural and divine Instinct of KNOWING GOOD and EVIL. For whether the Precept is inculcated and made known to Man by Divine Revelation, immediate, or scriptural, or merely by the natural Instinct in Man, of knowing Good and Evil, it may nevertheless be justly esteemed �a fundamental Axiom of the Law of Nature.�
The Jews and Christians, indeed, are taught the value and importance of this Precept by the Holy Scriptures, yet this is not the only means of its being known and received among men as �a Rule of Obedience;�-for, besides the example which I have already given concerning the Emperor Alexander Severus, it appears that (the Gentiles, in every part of the world, have demonstrated a sense of this Precept, without the assistance of Holy Scripture: not only the ancient Greeks and Romans, but the remote inhabitants of China and America: of which a few examples are here subjoined from the additional notes of the translator of Puffendorf.
Thus it appears, that not only the Heathen nations of Europe, but also the distant uninformed inhabitants of China and America, were endued, by their innate Knowledge of Good and Evil, with general ideas of that most excellent Precept which CHRIST himself has declared to be the true Christian RULE OF ACTION: and which, therefore, may justly be esteemed �a fundamental Axiom of the Law of Nature,� viz-Matt. The meaning and apparent intention of this GOLDEN RULE is exactly the same, in effect, as the other great commandment of the Law, �Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;� so that all persons, who carefully examine these and other parallel texts, must necessarily be convinced, that the command to love our neighbor as ourselves is the �ONE PATERNAL PRECEPT,� or rather, I should say, the only, since by the highest authority we are assured, that the equitable rule of �doing to others, as we would that men should do unto us;� or, in short, to love our neighbour as ourselves, �is THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS;� which implies as much as if our Lord had said, This is the Spirit, or FIRST PRINCIPLE, OF LAW, and contains the Sum and Essence of all other Laws! The Testimony of the Apostle Paul is nearly to the same effect-so that no other �paternal Precept� can possibly be received as a general Rule of Obedience for all occasions except this alone; which must therefore be acknowledged as the fundamental Rule, both of Natural and Revealed Law. Concerning this Golden Rule of Action, I have wrote a separate Tract under the title of the Law of Liberty, or Royal Law, to which I must beg leave to refer my readers for further remarks on that head.
Having now proved, I hope, that this �FUNDAMENTAL AXIOM OF THE LAW OF NATURE� ought to be �THE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE OF ACTION IN MAN,� I can more safely resume my discourse concerning �Principles of Action� in general. It has already been shown, that �the Knowledge of Good and Evil� is �an universal Principle� in Man, as well as Self-love. Bur I must now remark, that the former has the following essential difference from Self-love as an universal Principle; viz. that it is never superseded, like the latter, by any just Motive of DUTY (though it is often violated in breach of DUTY through human Frailty); for all just Motives of DUTY are perfectly consistent with it, and influence the heart under its direction and guidance, and even the most noble Motive to Action (independent of Inspiration, or immediate Revelation) is so far from superseding the natural �Knowledge of Good and Evil,� that it may, more properly, be esteemed an exertion of it: for instance, by a due exertion of �the Knowledge of Good and Evil,� we promote the very first Principle of all Duty, as it is the first great commandment, viz. The Love of God; for if we have �Knowledge to chuse the Good, and reject the Evil,� the same Knowledge must incline us to prefer the Author of all Good (when revealed to us) and his Commandments before every other consideration; for so Abraham�s Obedience in attempting to sacrifice his son, was rendered acceptable to God: he knew his Maker and supreme Lord by unquestionable Revelation; and, therefore, justly concluded, through his natural �Knowledge of Good and Evil,� that the Command of God ought to supersede all natural Affection, and Self-love; so that this was an Effect of Reason, which seemed to counteract even the Principles of Reason itself, by dissolving all the ties of Nature! But the Patriarch thereby gave an ample proof of a sincere Faith, and of an unfeigned Love to his Creator.
By what Principle of Action also was Moses induced (though the meekest of Men) to remonstrate to his Creator, when the Divine Indignation was declared against the Ingratitude and Wickedness of the children of Israel, in worshipping the molten calf during the time that Moses continued in the mount to receive the Law? 
Moses would not have declined the acceptance of such a distinguished honour, when tendered to him even by the ALMIGHTY LORD OF THE UNIVERSE, whose right of disposal could not justly be called in question! But the faithful minister of the Israelitish commonwealth did not seem to entertain the least sense of that imaginary �paternal Precept� mentioned above, �that Man should pursue his own Happiness:� for his answer on that occasion proves, that he was actuated by a Principle infinitely superior to Self-love; I mean a true and unfeigned Zeal for the Glory of God, arising from a right use of his natural discretion, or �Knowledge of Good and Evil,� which directed his choice, and enabled him to set aside all consideration of SELF, or private worldly Interest, when he thought the circumstances of the proposition seemed likely to affect the honour of God in the misinformed opinion of the Egyptians and other Heathens. Thus God was pleased to manifest his regard and consideration even for Human Judgement!-even for the opinion of a mere Man, when founded on Reason, and other just Principles, such as mankind are capable of exerting! And shall earthly monarchs, then, presume to despise any reasonable remonstrances of their fellow men-of their equals in every other respect, except that of a delegated office, when it is apparent that even the SUPREME LORD, and MAKER OF ALL THINGS, has condescended to hear and graciously receive a remonstrance from his Creature Man? Nay, and that repeatedly on various occasions! The like remonstrance was also made by Moses, when God declared his anger against Israel, for murmuring at the report given of the promised land; and for proposing to return into Egypt; and also for attempting to stone Joshua, and Caleb, who had endeavoured to appease, and convince them of their error.
But the noble Principles (far superior to Self-love) by which that Great Minister of State generally regulated his conduct, once more prevented his acceptance of the glorious promise, even though tendered by his Maker! His sincere regard for the Glory of God, agreeable to the first great Commandment, made him jealous lest the Heathen nations should falsely conceive, that the LORD JEHOVAH was not able to bring his people (the Israelites) into the land which he �sware unto them;� so that his Zeal for the Glory of God was, manifestly, the principle Motive of his answer on that occasion. And though a natural Affection (or brotherly Love) for his countrymen might, probably, be also included as an additional Motive to his intercession (worthy our imitation) yet his �own Self-love� was manifestly, quite out of the question; since he might have attained for himself the highest pitch of worldly glory, without forfeiting his real or eternal Happiness by such an acquisition; for as the offer was made by �the God of the spirits of all Flesh,� the acceptance of it could not have been imputed to him as sinful; though the contrary behavior was apparently more agreeable to the will of the Almighty, who was pleased to signify his approbation of Moses�s remonstrance and intercession, by declaring to him � �I have pardoned according to thy word.�
Also upon the rebellion of Korah, related in the 16th chapter of Numbers, when God spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, -�Separate yourselves from among this congregation, THAT I MAY CONSUME THEM IN A MOMENT.� Yet these two great leaders of Israel were so little actuated by that imaginary �universal Principle of Action,� SELF-LOVE, that they were entirely regardless of their own danger, notwithstanding the divine warning, and seemed to have no other care but that of endeavouring to save their brethren from GOD�s wrath; for it does not appear, that they retreated, or separated themselves �from among the congregation,� as they were expressly directed, but only �fell upon their faces,� and exerted the powers of Human Reason in the following short remonstrance to their Maker.
