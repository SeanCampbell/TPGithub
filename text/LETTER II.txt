LETTER II
March 22, 17 74
   T0 every man of candour, I apprehend it must be evident, that Parliament hath not the rights of sovereignty over his Majesty's American subjects.Every species, indeed of declamation and sophistry, have been made use of in order to shew that it hath, because it gratifies the pride of Englishmen in general, to think that that legislature, in which they feel themselves to have a share, should govern half the world: but there are not wanting an honest few who think more justly and more generously. Amongst this number, a writer who subscribes himself A. B. in the Public Advertiser of the 22d, deserves the thanks of every friend to freedom. Except in his idea of the country of America, having been by the prerogative the property of the crown, which, in
she sense of the passage, signifies the King exclusively, I entirely agree with him in sentiment. He hath clearly and elegantly refuted the notion of parliamentary sovereignty; he has, with a generous warmth becoming an
Englishman, appealed to the manly sense and to the virtue of his countrymen. It would be an endless, as well as an useless work, to follow the many daily writers along all the mazes they wander through, in order to assert the sovereignty of parliament, and to justify administration in the harsh measures they are now carrying into execution. Notwithstanding their laboured and fine-spun performances, there is in reality no difficulty in the case. We have no need of profound learning, nor an intimate acquaintance with antiquity, nor even of the history of the respective provinces and their different origins; neither do we want copies of grants, charters, or acts of parliament, in order to judge of the question before us. If we comprehend but the most well-known
principles of the English constitution; if we comprehend but a few of the plain maxims of the law of nature, and the clearest doctrines of Christianity, all which are so simple and plain, as to be understood by hundreds, nay thousands, of plain men who know not that they are possessed of so useful a treasure, we have knowledge enough on this occasion. The only requisite wanting beyond this, is a heart strictly devoted to truth and virtue, without which we {hall never understand any doctrine that does not soothe our passions.
   The gospel of civil as well as religious salvation is hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed onto babes; that is, unto those who are not puffed up
with vanity and false learning, nor blinded by pride, ambition, and self-interest, but whose minds are in a state of humility and innocence. But we have our political Popes, who would fain have us distrust our common sense and our feelings, and believe implicitly in their infallibility; nor do I doubt, but they would prove as faithful guardians of civil, as the Roman Pope is of religious, liberty, was it once put into their hands. 
   It is a capital error in the reasonings of several writers on this subject, that they consider the liberty of mankind in the same light as an estate or chattel, and go about to prove or disprove their right to it by the letter of grants and charters, by custom and usage, and by municipal statutes. Hence too we are told, that these men have a
right to more, those to less, and some to none at all. Such a title to the liberty of mankind is not established on such rotten foundations: 'tis not among mouldy parchments, nor in the cobwebs of a casuist's brain we are to look for
it; it is the immediate, the universal gift of God, and the seal of it is that free-will which he hath made the noblest constituent of man's nature. It is not derived from any one, but original in every one; it is inherent and unalienable. The most antient inheritance cannot strengthen this right; the want of inheritance cannot impair it. The child of a slave is as free-born, according
to the law of nature, as he who could trace a free ancestry up to the creation. Slavery in all its forms, in all its degrees, is an outrageous violation of the rights of mankind; an odious degradation of human nature. It is utterly impossible that any human being can be without a title to liberty, except he himself hath forfeited it by crimes which make him dangerous to society.
   Let us then hear no more of a right in our present constituted parliament to govern the Americans, as being derived from any former exercise of this sovereignty from the original dependence and protection of the emigrants and infant colonies, or from the tenour of grants and charters! The respective governments in America, are no longer dependent colonies; they are independent nations. - Not that I allow they ever were otherways than free (although dependent) in the most absolute sense: All their original constitutions either were, or ought to have been on the true principle of freedom. They are not to be deprived of it as a man would lose an estate, by a flaw in their title; for I have already proved, that their title can have no flaw. Those who are so fond of placing them metaphorically in the relation of children to a parent state, and thence are childish enough to argue for a blind filial obedience, should re-collect, that the power of a parent, even during childhood, doth not extend to any act of tyranny or injustice; and totally ceases when the child arrives at years of maturity. Then, as to the property of a child, a parent cannot take it from him even with his consent; and as soon as his independency puts it in his power to give it to his parent, he hath also the power of with-holding it if he think proper. In short, during infancy, he must
be protected agreeable to the laws of equity; when arrived at manhood, he is free, and becomes his own protector. But analogy not being the safe road of reason, we resign it again, after this short excursion, to those who carelessly range the field? of politics for amusement; but are not solicitous, as we are, of reaching the abodes of truth and freedom.
   The Americans, in common with the whole race of man, have indisputably an inherent right to liberty; and to be governed by such laws as shall best provide for the continuance of that liberty, and for securing their property. These are the hinges on which turn the welfare and happiness of society ; these are the true, the only ends of civil government. But how are they to be obtained under the sovereignty of a British Parliament? Are not the legislators of every free state to be bound themselves by the laws they make? And, must they not tax their own purses, together with those of their constituents? Is there any safety for the people without these ties upon their legislators? Will a member of the British parliament be bound by any law enacted for, and confined toï¿½America? Must the purses of the Americans be at his mercy, while his own shall be exempt from every taxation he may vote? What English school-boy, so ignorant of the constitution, as to admit these absurdities?
He must first go out into the world, and, by the help of a little political sophistry, unlearn his common-sense, and even his ABC.
   The secure enjoyment of liberty and property, in which consist the welfare and happiness of a people, being the true ends of all civil government; this is the foundation alone on which we must argue concerning who have a right to govern. The answer is obvious and short. The rights of sovereignty reside in the people themselves; that is, they have a right to chuse their own governors.
Minds that do not feel the force of self-evidences may deny the truth of this simple proposition: but they maybe assured, that if they set themselves about controverting it, they will only bewilder themselves in their own subtleties, without telling us any thing that will benefit mankind. Don't we all acknowledge, that the Americans are a free people? But how are they free, if they cannot choose their own governors; if their laws be not enacted by their own representatives? In what doth our freedom consist if not in these very rights as the essence of it? In these rights which we have so often asserted, for which we have so often bled! That people cannot be free who are not governed by their own consent. Those who are governed by their own consent, choose their own governors. This is indispensably requisite towards the welfare and
happiness of every people; it is an unalterable law of nature; that is, it is the law of God.
