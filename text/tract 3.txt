The like Remonstrance, founded in sound Reason and natural Equity, had once before been made even to the Almighty himself, by his faithful Servant ABRAHAM, when God condescended to reveal to him the awful decree of Divine Vengeance against the populous cities of the plains of Sodom.
Thus a due exertion of right Reason demonstrated the Dignity of Human Nature, and the examples, just mentioned, sufficiently prove, that THE ALMIGHTY requires his Creature Man to judge of Right and Wrong, and to form and declare a sound Judgment upon the eternal Principles of Justice and Righteousness, agreeable to that Divine Knowledge with which the Human Mind is most certainly endowed.
Though Abraham and his descendants, Moses and Aaron, knew that they could not exist, even a single moment, without the immediate protection of Divine Providence, yet they thought it their duty to remonstrate even to their CREATOR on the eternal Principles of �Justice and Judgment!�
THE ALMIGHTY SEARCHER OF HEARTS knew beforehand what they would say, and the propriety of their future answers; and, therefore, undoubtedly afforded them these extraordinary opportunities of proving to all mankind their Knowledge of Good and Evil, as well as their Faith and entire dependence on the eternal �Justice and Judgment� of the Divine BEING, that these clear examples of the Knowledge and Dignity of Human Nature, as also of the regard and consideration which even the great Author of that Nature was graciously pleased to manifest, on those occasions, towards the mental Faculties of his Creature Man, might be recorded to the end of time!
Concerning the Spirit of �Justice and Judgment� with which Abraham was endowed, God previously declared. So that Abraham�s Remonstrance, wherein he appealed to �the JUSTICE and JUDGMENT� of GOD, was apparently agreeable to the foreknowledge and expectation of the Almighty, as well as the other Remonstrance of Abraham�s descendants, Moses and Aaron. For these extraordinary exertions of Human Reason, in appealing to the Divine Justice, were so far from being offensive even to THE SUPREME AND ETERNAL SOVEREIGN OF THE UNIVERSE, that, on the contrary, he clearly manifested his approbation by the gracious manner in which he accepted and answered these human petitions! He condescended to satisfy the righteous and just Spirit of ABRAHAM, by an assurance, that even �if ten righteous persons� only could be found amongst the wicked nations in the plains of Sodom-�I will not destroy it� (said he) �for the tens sake.� And to the Remonstrance of Moses and Aaron (the descendants of the just ABRAHAM) the like favourable attention was paid by �the God of the Spirits of all Flesh:� �for as their petition was offered up in behalf of the whole congregation (viz. that they might not suffer for the fault of one or a few persons) God condescended to spare the Congregation, though they had justly incurred the forfeiture of life by joining the haughty and factious princes of Israel in open rebellion to the Divine Ordinances, contrary to the clearest evidence of all their senses! For Moses, on offering up this short petition, was immediately directed to separate the Congregation from the more notorious offenders- And accordingly all persons, that had grace sufficient to repent of their connections with these wicked men, - And immediately afterwards God was pleased to justify Moses, and to demonstrate the truth of his Divine Mission, by a tremendous and unusual example of Vengeance upon the hardened offenders and their families! And this being done in the presence of the whole Congregation, (then a populous nation) the evidence of it (which is handed down to us by their descendants, the Jews, and has also been confirmed, from time to time, by other instances of Divine Vengeance upon the same nation) was thereby rendered incontestable! �This further rebellion having once more provoked the Divine Justice, the cloud covered the tabernacle, and the glory of the Lord appeared! And Moses and Aaron were once more commanded to separate themselves from the Congregation, that a National Vengeance might take place! �Nevertheless, these two worthy Ministers of God discovered no sense of fear for themselves, whilst the national danger demanded their endeavours in behalf of their brethren; and therefore, instead of separating themselves, as they had been once more commanded, they, once more, �FELL UPON THEIR FACES,� to implore the Divine mercy and forgiveness of the national iniquity; so that Self-love was manifestly superseded by Patriotism and brotherly Affection! And as the plague was already begun among the people, the mediation of these two men was so far favoured by the God of Israel, that Moses was inspired with wisdom and presence of mind to instruct his Brother Aaron how to �make an atonement for the people� by the burning of incense-And accordingly Aaron �stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was slayed.�
These are unquestionable examples to demonstrate, that �Self-love� is not �the universal Principle of Action.�
Upon a former intercession also of Moses in behalf of his ungrateful countrymen, he permitted his natural Affection for them, to carry him (seemingly) far beyond the bounds of Reason and Moderation, in his expressions to the Almighty; even so far as to wish that he himself might be blotted out of God�s Book, if the sin of the people was not forgiven! So that Self-love is by no means �the universal Principle of Action.�
The affectionate Apostle Paul seemed also equally anxious for the eternal welfare and prosperity of the same great Nation; and he expressed the like unbounded Love towards them, by one of the strongest hyperbolical expressions (as Mr. Burkitt calls it) that he could possibly have chosen for that purpose.
And though the Apostle, by the words, might perhaps mean to refer only to that anathema of temporal misery and destruction denounced by Christ himself, against Jerusalem, and the unbelieving Jewish nation, for their open rejection of the Gospel; yet it is manifest, that the affectionate and truly patriotic Apostle would have been ready to suffer every kind of temporal misery, and even to lay down his Life for the refractory Nation, if he could thereby have averted the approaching vengeance from his countrymen, and restored them to Grace and the promised Privileges of the Gospel, to which they had been the first invited of all other nations! And therefore we cannot surely conceive, that �the Principle of Action,� or Motive to such a declaration, was Self-love.
The disinterested Principle of this Apostle are evident also from some other expressions, and especially from that in his Epistle to the Romans, viz. �peradventure for a good Man� (says he) �some would even dare to die;� which idea totally excludes the Principle of Self-love. But though the Apostle�s Expressions sufficiently prove that Self-love was not his Principle of Action, yet the same was more effectually demonstrated by his Life and Practice!
And again, - When we read of Jonathan�s inviolable Friendship towards David, can we conceive, that he was actuated by Self-love? We cannot mention that Principle without injustice to the generous character of that truly noble Prince, unless we speak of it comparatively, to show, that his Friendship and brotherly Love was equal to it; for the Scripture repeatedly informs us.� that he loved DAVID �as his own Soul.�
It was not an unreasonable Friendship; he was well convinced of the Merit and Virtue of David; for on these he founded his Love; and he had too much Virtue himself to violate a reasonable Friendship, even though his own private Interest and very Inheritance was his at stake!
These points were most earnestly pressed upon him with all the authority that an anxious worldly-minded father could possibly assume, and yet without effect-Now, if Self-love had been the Principle of Action with JONATHAN, he could not have greater temptation! But he knew how �to refuse THE EVIL, and CHUSE THE GOOD,� and would not, therefore, submit (like modern statesmen) to the wretched policy of doing �Evil that Good might come!� �Honour and Justice were his �Principles of Action;� and he was willing to risque, not only his worldly dignity and state, but his life also, rather than injure and forsake an innocent man! �Wherefore shall he be slain?� (said he) �What harm hath he done?�-And when he found that his father persisted in his base resolution, he was filled with honest indignation; and, as the text informs, �rose from the table IN FIERCE ANGER� �not on account of his father�s injurious behaviour to himself, in attempting to kill him with a javelin, but because �he was grieved FOR DAVID� (says the text) and that �his father had done him shame.� 
And again-Was David, King of Israel, actuated by Self-love, when he tendered his own Life, to save the Lives of his Subjects, praying God to, instead of the nation in general?
Surely his Principles of Action were very different from Self-love, or from that imaginary PATERNAL PRECEPT of �seeking his own Happiness!�
His Conscience probably informed him that he was guilty before God in having numbered the Israelites, to satisfy some vain or presumptuous curiosity concerning the Strength of the Nation, at a time when his whole confidence and hope of success against his enemies ought to have been placed in GOD alone; and he would perhaps then recollect, that the same sinful Presumption within himself, which had occasioned the undertaking, had also occasioned the neglect of that tribute or offering to God, which, in the Law, is expressly enjoined to be given as a ransom for the Soul of every individual of that nation, whenever they should be numbered, viz. half a shekel for every one:
REASON and CONSCIENCE therefore taught him, that he himself was the principal aggressor; and these just Principles, joined to a patriotic Regard for the Preservation of his Countrymen, certainly induced him to present himself to God as the proper victim of divine Vengeance!
It would, surely, by highly absurd to attribute so pathetic and penitent a declaration to the Principle of Self-love.
The Monarch of Israel was actuated by a much less reasonable �Principle of Action,� (and still very opposite to Self-love) when he uttered that bitter lamentation for the death of his wicked, rebellious and incestuous Son Absalom- �Would to God� (says he) �I had died for thee my Son!�
NATURAL PATERNAL AFFECTION was more powerful in this case than REASON; and every other Principle of Action, even Self-love (which is also a natural Affection, and generally very potent) was entirely superseded by it: for the King most earnestly wished, that he himself had died, instead of that unnatural wretch, who (he was well aware) ceased not, whilst he lived, to plot his father�s ruin, being an enemy (he well knew) that was implacable, that was restless, and impatient to deprive him, not only of his kingdom, but of his life; and had already violated his bed, in the most publick and shameless manner, with the detestable crime of incest!-There was no room to hope for the reformation of a wretch that had so entirely lost all distinction between GOOD and EVIL!-No gleam of happiness for his injured father, but in his death!-And yet paternal Affection compelled the latter to esteem even his own death preferable, if he could thereby have prolonged the wretch�s life!-
Thus it appears that SELF-LOVE is by no means �the universal Principle of Action,� since there are other Affections, which sometimes supersede it, and become the leading Principle of Action.
A certain noble Author of the last century, in a work, intituled �A View of the Soul,� has several chapters concerning the Power and Influence of the Affections over all the other natural faculties, Reason itself not being excepted: and in one chapter he attempts to prove, �that some Affection is the substantial Part of the Soul.�
But though the Affections are certainly to be esteemed �Principles of Action,� yet they cannot at any rate be admitted as �Rules of Obedience� (as I have before observed concerning the Affection of Self-love) because the generality of Mankind are more liable to be influenced by evil, misplaced Affections, than by those which might tend to their real Happiness.
The Affections of the avaricious Man for instance, are all subordinate to his Affection for amassing temporal wealth: -he may love his wife and children, perhaps, when the natural Affections of the husband and parent do not interfere with his predominant passion for riches; but, whenever they do, the wretch loses all feeling for his own flesh and blood, and will eagerly sacrifice to MAMMON the peace of his family, and the happiness of his beloved children, even in the most material circumstance of their lives! And though such a wretch is sometimes influenced, indeed, by the more general Principle of Self-love (that is, whenever the consideration of Self happens to fall in competition with his duty to other men) yet even Self-love itself must yield to the Love of Hoarding, since it is the well-known characteristic of the Miser to withhold all the comforts of life, even from HIMSELF, in order that he may indulge his unreasonable Affection for amassing wealth; which Depravity, if not assiduously and carefully checked in time, will most surely increase with age, till it becomes inveterate and irresistible, so as entirely to enslave its wretched Votary!
It would be well for such men, if they deprived themselves only of temporal comforts; but, alas, AVARICE defeats SELF-LOVE, even in its most important concern, Eternal Welfare. Compare this with what has already been mentioned in pages 23-30.
The depraved Appetites and Affections of Drunkards and Gluttons are also PRINCIPLES OF ACTION, which are frequently too powerful both for Reason and Conscience, and even for Self-love! For they too often lead Men with their eyes open to certain destruction, even though they are warned by the clearest Conviction and Foreknowledge concerning the inevitable consequences of their respective vices! Diseases, misery, and death may stare them in the face, and mark them, by their gradual approaches, as the unfortunate victims of these criminal indulgencies;-but how seldom do they deter! Nay, the certain expectation even of eternal damnation is not sufficient to reform them; and the learned Dr. Hales has produced an example concerning Drunkards, to prove that they would go on, even though they should see Hell-Fire before their eyes!
The depraved Affections for every other vice, as Lust, Gaming, &c. are equally capable of supplanting the universal Principles of Self-love and Common Sense; and do frequently carry Men headlong to destruction, when it is impossible but that they must have foreseen the necessary consequences of their inordinate pursuits!
How carefully, therefore, ought Mankind to guard themselves against every unlawful Affection; and strenuously to resist them, whenever they occur, lest any undue Affection should become the reigning Principle of Action, and lead the poor enslaved mortal to eternal destruction!
But many actions which may seem apparently to have been occasioned merely by corrupt Affections, are nevertheless promoted by a more latent cause: I mean the Inspiration or Influence of the spiritual Enemies and Deceivers of Mankind, which must also be reckoned amongst the various Principles or Motives to Action; because nothing can be more certain, than that these incorporeal MALIGNANT BEINGS take a most dangerous advantage (though unperceived) of all immortal carnal Affections in unguarded worldly Men; and do thereby lead the unwary and careless Liver into the most detestable Slavery that they may dishonor the work of God, and prepare the deluded Mortal for eternal shame and punishment!
The amazing power and force of the unlawful Affections, which I have already described, cannot reasonable be accounted for, on any other Principles. We have no right, however, to murmur at God�s permission of spiritual Temptations (whereby the Divine Knowledge of Good and Evil, presumptuously assumed by Man, is proved and tried) especially as the Almighty has mercifully been pleased to give us the most ample warning throughout the Scriptures of our continual danger; insomuch that the Christian Church hath generally made the necessary resistance to Evil Spirits an express Article of the Baptismal Vow, viz. To �renounce the Devil and all his Works.� Nevertheless, the unreasonable Heresy of the Sadducees (who were the Deists of ancient times) not only subsists to this day, but seems even to prevail in a most dangerous degree; for there are many people amongst us, who profess to believe the Scriptures, and yet openly deny the existence of those malignant spiritual Beings, commonly mentioned and signified under the name of �the Devil,� though the Scriptures afford the clearest testimony concerning them: but our modern Sadducees endeavour to explain all texts, wherein Devils or Evil Spirits are mentioned, as mere customary figures of speech expressive of some Evil Affections, and sometimes of mere bodily Disorders. However plausible this kind of sophistry may appear, where applied to some few particular passages, yet there are others so clear in the literal expression, and so well guarded by the scope or intention of the subject delivered in the context, that it is impossible to wrest them from the obvious literal meaning, without perverting all the rules of grammar and common sense. We are most carefully warned by the great Apostle to the Gentiles, to be upon our guard against these powers of darkness.
In the same Epistle the Apostle still further warns the Ephesians against the SPIRITUAL ENEMY. And, in his 2d Epistle to the Corinthians he signifies his forgiveness to some offending person (probably meaning that fornicator whom he ordered in the 1st Epistle to be excommunicated. The Apostle James also warns us upon the same points: �Resist the Devil� (says he) �and he will flee from you.� And the Apostle Peter is still more particular in his advice on this head.
The Word which is here translated �down to Hell,� viz. (�down to Tartarus,� or �in Tartarus;�) is derived from the Greek verb Terreo, to dread, or be in Terror; so that even if Tartarus, or Hell, does not signify a real Place, it signifies, at least, an actual State or Condition of extreme Terror and horrible Darkness, in which even SPIRITS may be involved, or (as it were) bound; for the Apostle, by the idea of Darkness here express, may perhaps allude to a total Exclusion from the Light, Comfort, and Influence of the Divine Grace, or an entire Withdrawing of the glorious CREATOR�S Light and Spirit, by which Exclusion or Withdrawing, the willful Reprobacy of these rebellious Angels might, probably, have been fixed upon them, as an indelible stain of infamy, to mark them for future punishment, and to exclude them from all hope of escaping the Divine Justice! So that those Spiritual Beings, which once were glorious in their Nature (being created �Angels of Light�) have rendered themselves most inglorious and detestable, by misusing that Liberty, in which the benevolent Creator had placed them; for they �kept not their first Estate, but� wickedly withdrew themselves from �their own Habitation,� and have thereby been the willful Authors of their own disgraceful and depraved Nature (the Diabolical Disposition); which is founded only in their voluntary wickedness; or rather, he tempteth NONE, no Beings whatsoever, and so that Iniquity can have no Fellowship with God, these Apostate Spirits have, of course, been totally excluded from every Ray of the Divine LIGHT; whereby, instead of continuing Angels of Light, as at first created, they are become totally dark, and opposite in every Principle to the LIGHT, Goodness, and Mercy of THE ALMIGHTY; so that they may now be called, with propriety, ANGELS of DARKNESS; for tho� they sometimes deceitfully assume the opposite character, in order to deceive the unwary, yet their Power is only of Darkness, being bound (as it were) in the dark chains of their own Iniquity or Reprobacy-in the �everlasting Chains� or horrible Darkness, whereby they are effectually �reserved for Judgment,� without being deprived of that activity, in exercising the malignity of their fixed reprobate Principles, and proneness to do Evil, which the Scriptures in many other passages attribute to them. For without some such supposition, how shall we reconcile the above-mentioned text of the Apostle Peter, as also that which is parallel to it in the Epistle of Jude, (wherein the fallen Angels are represented as bound �in everlasting Chains under Darkness unto the Judgment of the Great Day�) with those other texts before quoted from the Apostles Paul, James, and Peter, concerning the Activity and Vigilance of Diabolical Spirits. 
The Apostle Paul, as I before remarked, warns us of �the Wiles of the DEVIL,� (by which word, in the singular number, is commonly understood the Prince, or chief of the fallen Angels) and tells, that being a clear declaration of the Agency and Activity of these invisible Spiritual Beings.
Again, the Apostle James tells us, to �resist the DEVIL, and he will FLEE from us;� which excludes every idea of his being actually bound in chains of confinement. And the Apostle Peter represents him as �a roaring Lion, that WALKETH ABOUT, seeking whom he may devour;� which absolutely forbids the belief of a local confinement in any one place: so that the Chains of Darkness in Tartarus may very well express such a total Darkness of Apostacy and absolute Reprobation, as I have supposed, wherein the disobedient Angels are bound and reserved for the day of Vengeance; for �THE EVERLASTING FIRE prepared for the DEVIL and HIS ANGELS;� being marked and distinguished from other Spirits by their confirmed propensity to Evil, and their continual opposition to every good Principle; which renders their final condemnation to that �everlasting Fire� inevitable; for �the DEVILS also believe and tremble:� by which, it seems, they foreknow their own certain condemnation, like those abandoned Human Sinners.
This clear description of Human Reprobacy opens to us a very probable idea of the Angelic Reprobacy, or the mode whereby the Nature of Devils was first occasioned; and at the same time proves, that Men are equally liable to fall into the same lamentable Degeneracy and horrible Apostacy from God, and thereby may become a sort of Devils, but indeed, of a very base and inferior order: for though they may be EQUAL, perhaps, IN WICKEDNESS (when the restraining Power of Conscience, or the Divine Knowledge of Good and Evil, is entirely effaced, or withdrawn from them) yet they must remain as much INFERIOR IN POWER and ABILITIES, as Human Nature is inferior to the created Part of Devils, I mean the Angelic Nature; for the Scriptures informs us, that ANGELS �are GREATER in Power and Might;� and consequently must retain a GREATER proportion of both, (i.e. Power and Might) even in their fallen State, than reprobate Men.
The Devils, or Satanical Spirits, are constantly represented in the Scriptures to be as diametrically opposite in their Nature to the infinite Goodness of GOD as Darkness is to Light; as Falsehood is to Truth; as implacable and unprovoked Malice! Is to everlasting Mercy and Love! And, therefore, as they were really �Angels� in �their first Estate,� so entire a change in their very nature may fairly be accounted as �Chains of Darkness� �of horrible Darkness! Wherewith they are bound, as it were, and reserved for eternal Judgment, without hindrance or impediment to their natural activity in promoting Evil, as far as God is pleased to permit, in order to prove the Faith of Mankind; as in the severe trials of Job�s patience, and also in the temptation even of our Lord himself, which cannot be otherwise understood than in a literal sense; for CHRIST in his Human Nature, not only overcame those extraordinary exertions of the Devil�s power, related by the Apostle Matthew and the Evangelists Mark and Luke but was also �in all points tempted like as we are (yet) without sin.�
