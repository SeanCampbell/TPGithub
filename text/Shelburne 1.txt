MR. Fox, was infinitely able in business, clear, penetrating, confident, and decisive in all his dealings with mankind, and of most extraordinary activity. His first connection was among the Torys. Everybody knows his origin. In 1727 he was elected for Hindon, and on a petition being preferred against him supported by Government, he made by his activity and his connections among the young men of fashion, such interest in the House of Commons, that to the amazement of the Minister, who looked upon it as a common petition easily carried as he should direct, he found the two first questions carried against him, and was not able to carry it at last without a very strong exertion of the power of Government. He thus felt the power of the Minister, and in seven years after, on his coming in, attached himself closely to him, and ever afterwards looked up to him as his model, insomuch that it was common to Mr. Winnington to say that the Foxes thought nobody could read or write except it was Walpole. His ambition was quite of a modern kind, narrow, interested: in short the ambition of office, which had the Court for its object, and looked on corruption as the only means to attain it. �I give you so much, and you shall give me in return, and so we�ll defy the world, and sing Tol de rol,� &c. His abilities and his conversation taking this turn, habit had so confirmed it that, when I knew him, he looked upon every other reasoning as mere loss of time, or as a sure mark of folly or the greatest knavery, for every set of men are honest; it�s only necessary to define their sense of it to know where to look for it; every man is honest and dishonest, according to the sentiments of the man who speaks of him; every man is artful too to the extent of his abilities. God made man so, and has given it to him in lieu of force; only one man places his art in deceiving publick assemblies, another in deceiving particular men, another women, &c. Nor are honesty and art absolutely opposite qualities, but I can conceive a sensible man very easily to do what is called honest, that is punctual in his dealing, and meaning well to the man he deals with to the best of his abilities, and very artful at the same time. Mr. Fox was thus extremely honest in all his dealings with individuals. His good sense made him so, if his nature did not. He was extremely artful too, and for this purpose was really to the greatest degree open, except in cases of the greatest necessity. Possessed by this means of this short road to power, he despised as it were knowledge, or at least put men of that stamp in a second class, and looked on all publick spirit as the spirit of faction. This was his political creed in which he believed himself, and recommended to others. He excelled in everything that came within it. He was clear, had a great spirit of order, arrangement, and economy in regulating everything that came before him; but formed to this his ambition was a mean one, never daring to look very high, ready to submit to everything, consequently timid, with a certain dread of the publick: the natural consequence of his system, for how could it be otherwise? His sense told him it was necessary to deal with individuals, and secure them each by particular services of consequence. He must have been apprehensive of such of them as were unsecured by bribes and promises, which being far the greatest part, his very conduct made him afraid of the publick, if he was not naturally so, which however there is the greatest reason to believe. He was proud to a great degree, envious even to bitterness, and revengeful, which, if well considered, will be found perfectly agreeable to his other qualities, and both of them illustrated by every action of his life. He had, however, an extraordinary degree of shrewdness and sagacity. 
As to foreign affairs, Mr. Fox had always entirely trusted to Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, first Envoy in Saxony, afterwards in Russia.� He was a man of wit, but nothing else. He was bred up the same as Mr. Fox, in the profligate school of Lord Hervey, and lost his senses while abroad in the midst of negotiations without anybody in England knowing it. His ingenuity and wit rather increased than lessened with his madness, so that he deceived all sides. Mr. Fox put an entire confidence in him, by which way he was enabled to spend immense sums under pretence of Secret Service, which no one knows how he disposed of. His dispatches which remain in the Secretary�s Office are a series of romances stating favours and bonnes fortunes which he never had, all which he pretended to turn to political account. Mr. Fox�s private letters to him and many others were lately discovered by a singular accident in Wales. Mr. Hanbury, who inherits his family estate, wanted to fit up a room, and looking for a chimney-piece opened some deal boxes which he had conceived an idea contained one, having laid for a long time in some storehouse; and proved instead of what was wanted to contain all Sir Charles�s papers, which it seems had been left in the possession of some French mistress, who returned them very honestly to the family; a proof that there is more honesty in the world that may be expected among a description which are very unjustly branded with everything that is bad, because they originally believed too readily the honesty of others.
What passed in the year 1757, in the struggle between Mr. Fox and Mr. Pitt, is too long to recapitulate. Mr. Pitt told him then he did not look upon him a man sui juris, because of the Duke of Cumberland. The fact is, Mr. Fox was not formed to be a man sui juris, else he would have been so. I have often thought Mr. Pitt then saw he could get the better of Mr. Fox when he pleased, but that he could not of the Duke of Cumberland. Mr. Fox bore all from Mr. Pitt which the superiority of his line, the favour of the people, on the great majority of whom he stood, the daringness of his temper, ready to risk everything, enabled him to surround himself with every time they appeared in publick.
Not one of Mr. Fox�s maxims did he dare to profess in publick, or if he did they were immediately run down by the great body of the people (while Mr. Pitt was in the midst of his system), and men were thus ashamed to perform in publick what they had promised to do in private, or did it as if they were ashamed. Mr. Fox�s system was built upon the ridicule of those very qualities the professing of which enabled Mr. Pitt to gain the heart of every disinterested man, at a time when the publick was supposed to be in the greatest danger. Mr. Fox retired laughing, as it were, and talking of Mr. Pitt as a madman, but necessarily conscious of his own inferiority. He abandoned all hope of returning to power, and gave himself up to his next passion, which was covetousness. He had an opportunity of satisfying this to the greatest degree in the Pay-Office, and exerting all his abilities in the pursuit, by his management taking proper advantage of the rise and fall of the Publick Stocks, with the publick money, a great deal of which necessarily lay in his hands. This, together with the fondness for his family, which was without bounds, together with the connection of some friends whom he still kept attached to him, were sufficient resources to occupy his mind. He was therefore prevailed on with the greatest difficulty to alter his resolution and to come to Court to assist Lord Bute in October 1762, and these reasons made him so very determined in making it a condition that he should retire at the year�s end. I have dwelt the longer on his character, because, if it�s well understood together with Lord Bute�s, it will not be at all difficult to comprehend every event that happened to the end of the Session.
Shelburne to Bute.
MY DEAR LoRD, � I am this moment honored with yours. I was in hopes His Majesty had seen the Duke of Rutland to-day, but I entirely agree with your Lordship that he should see him as soon as possible. Perhaps if twelve hours were given him to consider after the King had seen him and the change offered him, his female friend would probably influence him to accept. He is certainly very sorry about the Duke of Devonshire, and wishes it had been first debated and considered, �What good can it do? What harm may it do?� but that, not out of regard to his Grace, nor meaning to extenuate the offence, nor at present even to lessen the King�s resentment, but merely with a view to what is to come, and from being of opinion that he is the most timid of those who may be now considered as endeavouring by the basest means to take His Majesty prisoner, and therefore that this indignity should be reserved for those who, though they had deserved, had not received any as yet. But as it is done, your Lordship may depend upon it, he will join you in justifying, not defending, it to the world. As to the Duke of Cumberland, I always told your Lordship, if Mr. Fox connected himself with you, His Royal Highness could not prevail to make him do anything contrary to the spirit of his engagements with you, but I never said that Mr. Fox�s judgment of the Duke was to be taken.
He feels that the Duke dishonors himself by such a conduct as you describe, and therefore halts to think it possible. And I believe I described his conduct so warmly and so home to the Duke, by adding what the King had said of him, as to make him of another opinion for the moment, though I readily believe your Lordship that it is changed. This is the case not only with regard to the Duke, but with anybody whom he has lived in friendship with, which you will find him, as I have often assured your Lordship, most uncommonly sincere in. For my own part I see it in most odious colours, but not less serious for their being odious. I do believe it requires the utmost activity and versatility in your Lordship to rescue the King from being liable the whole of his reign to such insults.
I am with great esteem and regard,
My dear Lord,
Ever yours,
SHELBURNE.
The majority, on the side of the government may be fairly said to have turned Mr. Fox�s head. He thought he had performed everything he promised, and that he could not be sufficiently rewarded. He therefore, being still determined to retire at the end of the year, that is to go to the House of Lords, no longer took any trouble about the individuals or the business of the House of Commons. His neglect of every individual with whom he was not particularly connected by relationship or interest hurt his character extremely, as it took off from the most amiable part of it, which was generally believed too. He was averse even to take the trouble of seeing them, and from that moment thought of nothing but what he should ask for himself, his brother, his nephews, his own and his wife�s relations, and his immediate dependents. With these he filled up most of the employments, which he prevailed on Lord Bute, to turn the Duke of Newcastle�s friends out of, without the least regard to the future carrying on of the King�s business. One event, however, happened which interrupted these considerations a little. Lord Bute�s Tory friends had pressed him to have an enquiry into the publick expenses as a popular and in every respect a very wise measure. Sir Philipps, the silliest of them, was so bent upon this silly idea, for so it certainly was considering it on the side of Government � as Government was composed � that he was determined to propose it, and propose it in his own way. Lord Bute felt so hampered, having committed himself on this subject, as he had very imprudently done on many of the same purport to Sir Dashwood and other people of the same stamp, that he thought he could not cleverly get off without appearing at least to come into it to a certain degree. He had a confused notion likewise that he might gain some popularity by it, and that he might deceive the world. Mr. Fox was most unaccountably afraid of it, insomuch that he could not conceal it from anybody, and was very imprudent in his opposition to it in the House of Commons, where he was left almost single, being deserted by Grenville, Elliot, and most of the second people. He deprecated it in vain with Lord Bute. It ended without doing him any publick harm, however, and has left in the world the impression of the most useless, contemptible, ridiculous, childish, and absurd measure ever proposed by Government, as attempts of that sort usually do, having failed.
North America naturally offers itself as the principal object of your Lordships� consideration upon this occasion, with regard to which I shall first obey His Majesty�s commands, in proposing to your Lordships some general questions, before I proceed to desire you will furnish that information which His Majesty expects from your Lordships, with regard to the northern or southern parts of this continent considered separately.
The questions which relate to North America in general are,
Ist. What new Governments should be established there? what form should be adopted for such a Governmentfi and where the capital or residence of each Governor should be fixed?
2ndly. What military establishment will be sufficient? What new forts should be erected? and which, if any, may it be expedient to demolish?
3rdly. In what way, least burthensome and most palatable to the Colonies, can they contribute towards the support of the additional expense which must attend their civil and military establishments upon the arrangement which your Lordships shall propose?
It now only remains that, in obedience to your Majesty�s commands, we give our opinions upon the mode of revenue least burthensome and most palatable to the Colonies, whereby they can contribute to the additional expense which must attend the civil and military establishments adopted on the present occasion. But on this point of the highest importance, it is entirely out of our power to form any opinion which we could presume to offer for your Majesty�s consideration, as most of the materials necessary to form a just and accurate judgment upon it are not within reach of our office. Such as can be procured shall be collected with all possible dispatch, and shall at any time, be laid before your Majesty in such manner as you shall please to direct.
Shelburne to Bute.
MY DEAR Lord, � I find by the newspapers they load me as well as they do your Lordship. It gives me very little uneasiness; med virtute me involvo.
But I should be very sorry your Friends did such severe injustice to the uniform conduct I have to this day preserved towards your Lordship as to join in it, which however I am told some of them do, and that the King and all his Council hear my name mentioned with the least regard. This is the reason given for trying every means to leave me friendless and setting me almost at open defiance. The whole of this is to me inexplicable. I hate to dwell upon it, and I only mention it to your Lordship, who I am persuaded will do me justice in regard to yourself at least. As to the King, surely there must have been sad misrepresentations : my past conduct, whatever my future may be, not having merited it of a generous Prince, whom I have often heard your Lordship say, felt so much from a different conduct than what my heart tells me, and you must be sensible I have ever observed towards him. I feel for his Person, for his Office, and for the State, and no accident I hope, will prevent my preserving the most temperate conduct with these views; none can certainly give me more concern than your not being thoroughly persuaded of the respect and esteem with which I am, and have been,
My dear Lord,
Most faithfully yours,
SHELBURNE.
Your conduct is likely to be as firm and manly in civil as it has been in military life, and will I hope do you equal honour. I do assure you I look upon it far above any compliment from me, for to me it has been kind beyond expression, and such as I am bound never to forget. lam sorry however to congratulate you on the honour you must acquire with every honest man at the expense of what I am hurt to name, and still more to think of the King and the publick. For depend upon it, this factious proceeding adopted by the Court, must be productive of dreadful evil to this country, already tottering by faction which seems stepping into the place of justice, and has already you see almost turned the judge off the bench. Introducing it at this moment into another profession in a manner so unprecedented as this, appears a most extraordinary measure and betrays the most abandoned principle.
Though it�s late at night, I would not scruple travelling, if I did not think it better for me to delay going to Court till Monday, especially if there is any question about going into the closet, till I can see and hear more of this measure, which I suppose cannot he meant to end with you and me, though I shall think nothing extraordinary, for the whole of this implies a communication certainly between Luton and administration: I am very curious to know the terms. I shall be at Whitton certainly on Sunday at five, where I shall be very glad to meet you and Calcraft, and bring all the information you can from every quarter. I shall have a thousand questions to ask you. Calcraft knew Ned Harvey better than I do, but if it is so, what is one to think of that creature called man? But you know how much account I make of temper in all human affairs, so I must take care not to transgress myself.
MY Lord, � It is impossible for me, except I could convey to your Lordship at the same time how desirous I have ever been, by unalterable duty and respect, to preserve His Majesty�s good opinion, to express to you the satisfaction and happiness it would give me to serve him in any situation, much more in the considerable one your Lordship does me the honour to point out to me. I am therefore extremely concerned that, besides the total ignorance I am under in regard to the measures you propose to pursue, a real consciousness of my own inability in so active an office, to which the domestic habits I have lately fallen into add not a little, makes it absolutely incumbent on me to decline the honour done me, through a conviction that more evil might come to His Majesty�s affairs than the little aid I could ever hope to give could compensate.
As to my future conduct your Lordship will pardon me if I say �measures and not men� will be the rule of it, especially as I can add that, besides the sincere affection I shall ever bear His Majesty�s person, my opinion of the present state of this country in many respects is such, as will make it matter of very serious concern to me, not to concur in whatever shall be proposed by His Majesty�s Ministers. This, as I recollect, contains the substance of my conversation to Mr. Dempster, when he did me the favour to call on me some time ago, and in the course of his visit took occasion to speak to me of myself. I am sorry it is impossible for me to give your Lordship any light in regard to Colonel Barr�. Too many public events have happened since he has been at a distance, that I cannot even conjecture what his sentiments may be in the present situation. Your Lordship may be assured, if he approves the public plan of government
proposed, I shall hear with the greatest pleasure of his obeying the King�s commands, and yielding to your Lordship�s wishes.
I have the honour to be, with great consideration and regard,
My Lord,
Your most obedient and humble servant,
SHELBURNe
Our friend Dempster has been with me to desire my opinion whether he should engage with the Duke�s Administration, with Lord Rockingham at the head of the Treasury. He had been applied to by Fitzherbert, but declined going to Lord Rockingham till he had seen me, upon which it was given him to understand that he would do a very agreeable service by finding out my opinion in this crisis, both as to myself and as to you. I returned his attention by advising him, as he seemed to approve the line of measures, by all means to assist the King if it suited his private arrangements. As to myself, I told him the less that was said of me the better; that I had lately entered into engagements of a domestic nature, which I did not choose to break through; but that, besides the affection I originally had for the King, I could not help feeling for him on this occasion, and commending a great part of his conduct, and would undoubtedly, when winter came, whoever was his Minister, if he proposed right measures, support them; as to you, that you must answer for yourself, when you came over; that I could not take upon me to conjecture even what your sentiments might be; that I influenced no man, not even my brother. There have been communications from other quarters, which I cannot trust to paper, but they ended in nothing particular, and in general have been upon the same line as this I mention, accompanied with the most moderate language towards particulars of all sides, and as much respect and affection to the King as I could convey through a third person. I wish I could give you further light out of this chaos which at present reigns throughout, in which the only wise plan appears to me is to stand still yet awhile. When you come over, you may be able to see clearer, but as I know by experience, it is pleasant at a distance to be advised freely, I would advise you by all means to prosecute your tour, and not return till the candles shew more light, unless sent for, and that in a very direct manner. I mean this to guard against general letters which Dempster or any one else may be desired to write you. You may depend upon hearing from me by a particular messenger, if I see anything likely to ripen in which I can take part, and if it continues as it has been, that I shall leave the ground as broad and open for you on every account as possible. It is hazardous writing, but I thought it fit at all hazards to convey to you my sentiments in general as to the crisis. I have desired Calcraft to forward it by express to Dover, and if possible to send it from Calais by a particular Messenger to Paris. He will write to you the common reports, though I don�t believe in anything for certain, except that Lord Rockingham is set down to be at the head of the Treasury on the Duke�s Plan.
Lord George Sackville was third son of Lionel, Duke of Dorset. His mother was the daughter of a Scotch gentleman of a private family. 
The old Duke of Dorset was born and bred in Queen Anne�s time; he was in all respects a perfect English courtier, and nothing else. A large grown full person, which together with some other circumstances procured him the friendship of Lady Betty Germain, who proved her attachment to him by leaving away from her own relations to his third son a very considerable property, upon condition of his taking the surname �Germain,� but to revert to them in case of his inheriting the Dukedom. He had the good fortune to come into the world with the Whigs, and partook of their good fortune to his death. He never had an opinion about public matters, which together with his qualifications as a Courtier and his being of an old Sussex family, a circumstance which weighed greatly with the Pelhams, kept him during his whole life in a continual succession of great places, such as Steward of the Household, twice Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, President of the Council, Warden of the Cinque Ports, &c. He preserved to the last, the good breeding, decency of manners, and dignity of exterior deportment of Queen Anne�s time, never departing from his style of gravity and ceremony. He was once at the play, when Mr. Cary, who had been his Secretary in Ireland, a light sort of a man, asked him across two or three benches, loud enough for those between to hear, whether my Lord Middlesex undertook the opera next year. The question at first discomposed the Duke somewhat, but he turned about and replied: � Upon my word, Mr. Cary, I have not considered what answer to make to such a question.�
His eldest son Lord Middlesex, I believe was never much heard of in public life. Lady Middlesex was generally understood, after Lady Archibald Hamilton, to have become the subject of the Prince of Wales�s attention (which appears more particularly from Lord Melcombe�s diary), to which her husband appears to have submitted very quietly, who it may be supposed led a dissipated life on his side. It appears by what Lord Melcombe says that he was early embarrassed in his affairs and considerably involved in debt, which together with other circumstances, made him always ill with his father. His appearance after the death of his father was always that of a proud, disgusted, melancholy, solitary man, and his conduct, particularly towards those who were to succeed to the title, being totally unprovoked on their part, went so far beyond what could have been dictated by his creditors or his wants, as to savour very strongly of madness, a disorder which there was too much reason to suppose, ran in the blood, from the behaviour of Lord John Sackville, the second son, who after marrying a daughter of Lord Gower under some very strange circumstances, behaved still more strangely when he was embarking with his regiment upon some expedition; so that his family thought it most prudent that he should resign his commission, and undergo a sort of family exile near Lausanne in Switzerland, where I saw him in the winter of 1700 living upon a very poor allowance and but very meanly looked after. He was very fond of coming among the young English at Lausanne, who suffered his company at times from motives of curiosity and sometimes from humanity. He was always dirtily clad, but it was easy to perceive something gentlemanlike in his manners, and a look of birth about him under all his disadvantages. His conversation was a mixture of weakness and shrewdness, as is common to most madmen. When he heard of his brother Lord George�s behaviour at the battle of Minden, he immediately said, �I always told you that my brother George was no better than myself.�
Lord George, the third son, afterwards Lord Sackville, had by these means a great road open to his father�s favour, on which he imposed by many circumstances so as to gain the entire and exclusive direction of him. He was a tall man, with a long face, rather strong features, clear blue eyes, a large make, though rather womanly, not too corpulent, and a mixture of quickness and a sort of melancholy in his look which runs through all the Sackville family, such as is seen in the antique statues often to accompany great beauty. He was educated at Westminster school, where he became connected with a remarkable set of men, who were then upon the Westminster foundation, the principal of whom were Mr. Murray, since Lord Mansfield; the two Stones, one of whom came to be Secretary to and in effect governed the Duke of Newcastle � the other, Primate of Ireland; Markham, since Archbishop of York, &c., a set of men who by sticking together and contenting themselves mostly with subaltern situations or at least with subaltern roads to great situations, pursuing always a Machiavelian line of policy, clinging to the Duke of Newcastle and his brother as long as they had any power left, and abandoning them as readily to pay their court to every new favourite, cultivating Whig connections with Tory principles, continued always to enjoy substantial power and patronage, while greater men were without difficulty suffered to do the business and take the honours of it.
From Westminster his father carried him to Ireland when he first went Lord Lieutenant, and during his absence from thence left him under the particular care of the Master of the Rolls there, Mr. Carter, a man of a very original character, whose uncommon sagacity and shrewdness as well as depth of understanding, would have distinguished and advanced him in any country. This shrewd old man observed Lord George Sackville�s countenance and manner dining at a side-table in his own house with some persons of his own age � Mr. Carter�s own table being full � when a slight dispute occurred; and saw enough into his character to make him advise the Duke of Dorset when he returned to Ireland, whatever he did with his son, never to put him into the army. Had the Duke followed this advice, the whole empire would probably have followed the fate of the particular parts which were committed to his care, for I do not conceive that anything but the checks which stopped his military career, could have prevented his being Prime Minister. He was however prepared for another destiny: he took the military line, and was rapidly advanced in it.
He commanded a regiment in Flanders and in Scotland. I have heard the officers of the regiment affirm that he was frequently found in Scotland listening at the officers� tents to hear what was said of him.
He afterwards attended his father when he was appointed a second time Lord-Lieutenant of that Kingdom as Secretary, and, together with Primate Stone, whom the Duke of Dorset made Primate, threw that kingdom into the utmost confusion, by attempting measures which Government had not the power either here or there to carry through, and which they had still less the ability and the weight to conduct? They attempted a change of measures and modes of administration at one and the same time, and without the least regard to public opinion, and that at a time when the characteristic of English Government was its moderation, and the only chance of its subsisting was its candour, its integrity, and its inoffensiveness: Mr. Pelham just dead, and the Duke of Newcastle weak and incompetent, attacked on all sides by younger men of ability and vigour, who were seeking for every breath of popularity to aid them against him.
Ireland had been governed by a few men who were called undertakers. They were commonly appointed Lords Justices in the absence of the Lord-Lieutenant, and were used on his arrival once in two years to undertake, as it was termed, to carry the business of government through the House of Commons there, upon condition of their obtaining a pretty good provision for themselves, and as hard a bargain for others as they could drive for Government; for their credit depended with the English Government upon the cheapness of it. The poor Duke of Dorset was made by his son and the Primate to commence politician and man of business at sixty. The undertakers were dismissed. Their weight, connections, and habits, which were formerly applied to keep the people ignorant, happy, and quiet, were immediately applied with all possible activity, for their existence depended on it, to instruct, to animate, and to disquiet them, in doing which they could find no great difficulty, considering that the character of the people was naturally turbulent, impetuous, and uncivilised, ten Roman Catholics without property or principle to one Protestant with or without property, new measures brought forward in a country where nothing new had been agitated since the Revolution, except the paltry business of Wood�s half-pence, which might have taught them experience; and the contrivers of all this without either solid sense, natural interest, or courage to support what they had undertaken.
It is natural to suppose under these circumstances that Government was defeated. The Primate was protected by his Primacy; Lord George Sackville escaped with difficulty from the fury of the populace. Another Lord Lieutenant was sent over to quiet things. The undertakers were restored, but could no longer make the good terms for Government which they used to do; things were laid too much open for the old system to revive; and there was no new system prepared to substitute in its place. The foundation was thus laid, and may be easily traced from that time to the total emancipation of the legislature of Ireland from that of Great Britain, and the complete Revolution which has since taken place in regard to the fundamental laws of Ireland.
His Irish unpopularity did not affect his line in England, where it was little attended to, and less understood; he rose rapidly in consideration, and his fortune ran quickly to its termin. In the military line he had no rival, at least no one who could cope with him in regard to family, fortune, connection, or talents for imposition and intrigue. Enough was known of his character for everybody to fear him, as he was generally understood to be of a vindictive implacable disposition. In a political line he did not as yet set up to be Minister, which made him an object to all parties as a second. Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox both bid for him; his Westminster connection secured him constant access to the Duke of Newcastle, and let him into every secret of that house, while he assiduously cultivated and promoted his mother�s country people, the Scotch, which made a form of union between him and the Earl of Bute. He naturally excelled in that species of dexterity and address which enabled him to turn all these circumstances to his consideration. The war breaking out, he could not avoid serving, which he chose to do upon the coast of France under the Duke of Marlborough, an easy, good-natured, gallant man, who took a strange fancy for serving, to get quit of the ennui attending a private life, without any military experience or the common habits of a man of business, or indeed capacity for either, and no force of character whatever. This opened a fine game to Lord G. Sackville, who played it off to the utmost. Instead of losing consideration by being only second in command, he gained considerably in the eyes of the army. He took every advantage of the Duke of Marlborough�s goodness and weakness of character, and in point of manner trespassed upon him without measure. Everything that was well done, every one that was served, it was all Lord George�s doing. Everything that was neglected or ill done, every fault that was committed, every person that was disobliged, it was all the poor Duke of Marlborough. Lord George�s favourites, emissaries, and expectants in the army, which were naturally without number, as there was no one else to look up to or fear, were perpetually occupied in running down the Duke of Marlborough for the purpose of crying up Lord G. Sackville, while the Duke of Marlborough had no one about him except a very shy son, and two or three good people, without any party or plan of making one, having ambitioned the command pretty much as a boy from school does a scarlet coat. Besides, his character was not made in any respect to resist or detect any man. He therefore naturally sunk under the art and management of the person next in command, but what is scarcely credible, yet what I know to be true, all the time he did so, he was in the habit of describing Lord G. Sackville in the most odious colours possible, and pointing out every failing which he had, but he did not know how to emancipate himself. Lord George took an equal lead in appearance though not in reality over Lord Howe, who, though in many respects the opposite of the Duke of Marlborough and disposed in consequence on most occasions to resist Lord George, yet did it in so awkward a manner, as only to give Lord George�s talents for intrigue a little employment. Lord George�s pride, which was naturally very great, grew into the most intolerable insolence. Everything fell before him till the fleet approached the coast. It would have been well for Lord George and perhaps for the public, at least so far as the particular service was concerned, if Lord George could have made the enemy feel any part of those powers which he displayed on board the Magnanime. It is painful to point out, and much more to dwell on failings which are incident to human nature, and at the same time lead to the contempt of it. The following lines which appeared in the newspaper in the course of the winter, sufficiently explain the character of the Lieutenant-General on shore. It is to be feared there was too much foundation for what is insinuated, and more need not be said. 
The army landed, reconnoitered St. Malo, burned a few empty ships, which were out of reach of the cannon of the place, and returned to the fleet and with the fleet to England.
It was not the business of any party to attack Lord George. Mr. Pitt had too much on his hands and felt his power too little established to risk it. The German war was at the same time resolved upon; six thousand of the best of the troops were detached from the coast of France to Germany. It was an object for several political reasons to have the troops commanded by the Duke of Marlborough and Lord George Sackville. Lord George had seen enough of that service not to wish to return to it, and therefore willingly left the remainder of the army under a General without interest and without favour, to attack with little more than half the number of troops and the regiments (now the French were everywhere upon their guard along the Channel to which our operations were visibly confined), the same or still stronger places on the coast than what he attempted with the whole, knowing as he thought pretty well what must come of it. On his arrival in Germany he continued to play the same game as before in regard to the Duke of Marlborough; but Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick formed a very different chapter from any he had ever yet to deal with. The Duke was bred not only in the camp but in the Court of Prussia; he was in all respects an experienced soldier, and a proud high man; he was in the habit of doing his business within himself, and had besides officers of character and experience who knew their business and were attached to him. He was the near relation of the King of Prussia, and recommended by him to the command of the allied army; he was likewise related to our King, and corresponded directly with him, while he was sure of Mr. Pitt�s vigorous support from motives of common interest; he had a corps of his own family troops in the army under the command of his nephew, the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick, besides a corps of Prussians, and the bulk of the army were Germans. He must have immediately seen Lord George�s inefficiency as a military man, and very quickly saw through his tricks, so that he knew what he had to expect, nor was he of a temper easily to endure any rival near the, throne. Lord George on his part immediately set himself to make a distinction and draw a line between English and German, to cultivate a line of popularity among the former which his very nature opposed, to pry into the accounts and the expenditure of the army, and to criticise and nibble at every move which Prince Ferdinand made, assuming as much in point of manner as the Duke�s own manner, who was himself a pretty good master of that science, would let him do. The Duke of Marlborough died of a fever at Munster. Lord George succeeded to be Commander-in-Chief of the British troops, and Lord Granby succeeded to be second in command, who was made for popularity had all the good qualities of the Duke of Marlborough but more force of character, more activity, and a natural turn to the army. He had his quarters, his purse, and his heart perpetually open to the whole army without the least spirit of intrigue. He took decidedly the line of Prince Ferdinand from no motive of jealousy or ill-will to Lord George, to whom he always behaved with more than respect, and a degree of honour which went the length of delicacy on all occasions, and refinement upon some, but from motives of probity, generosity of nature, and a laudable ambition. A little anecdote may serve to show how much Lord George risked in regard to Prince Ferdinand, and of how much imprudence he was capable.
The night but one before the Battle of Minden at supper at the head-quarters, Lord George dwelt during the whole supper upon the character of the Mar�chal de Contades, who commanded the French army, extolling him in the highest degree. Prince Ferdinand, who was naturally touchy, bore it for a considerable time, till his patience becoming exhausted, he could not help breaking out.
What happened at the Battle of Minden sufficiently appears from the papers of the time. No military man can have any difficulty in forming a just judgment of Lord George�s conduct, who compares the paper he wrote and circulated immediately upon Prince Ferdinand�s issuing the order which reflected upon him with his defence at his court-martial. The conduct of the army towards him was scandalous; he was universally deserted. Those who were accustomed to fawn upon him even after the battle, when the order came to be issued neglected, nay even insulted him. It may be curious to observe, to show his habit of imposing, that immediately after the battle he came up to the 20th Regiment, with whom he was always unpopular, talked of the glory of the day, and confounded the officers, who had just come out of the heat of the action, by addressing himself to Colonel Tenant, who was then Captain of Grenadiers.
Upon his return he was tried, and sentenced in terms the most humiliating which could be invented. It was understood that his life was spared out of regard to his family, and to the earnest intercession of his father.
The old King wanted him expelled the House of Commons, and pressed the measure upon Mr. Pitt in the presence of Lord Holdernesse, who persisted in declining it, alleging that if he was expelled and afterwards came to be re-elected, which might happen for some family borough, he did not see what the House of Commons could do, which marked a sagacity in Mr. Pitt which did him the highest honour, considering all that since happened upon Mr. Wilkes� expulsion; the King finding Mr. Pitt persist, turned round to Lord. After this Lord George sank into obscurity and general contempt. No man would be seen to speak to him in the House of Commons or anywhere else. However, he persevered, till men grew weary of showing him a contempt which did not abash him. At last the Rockingham party in 1765, who wanted equally both penetration and fortitude, were the first to whitewash him, for no other reason than that they were under an apprehension that they should have nobody to speak for them the first day of the Session, on account of the seats of the principal persons of the party being vacated in consequence of their accepting office till they could be re-elected. They did not venture to restore him to his military rank, but they brought him back to the Privy Council, and appointed him Vice Treasurer of Ireland. Lord Chatham coming in the following year dismissed him from being Vice Treasurer, while, however, both he and the Court had gained the grand point of his being once more producible to great employment. To this end he continued taking the most popular part he was capable of, and recovering as much consideration as he could, which his new friends were very well calculated to give him, While he took care to have the advantage of them, till the Court, with which he was always connected underhand, thought it proper to call him forth to be American Secretary. The Court itself, and indeed most men were dupes to his imposing manners, and gave him credit for a great deal more ability than he had. Whatever some might pretend, there was but one opinion about his military incapacity, but he was supposed to have great Civil talents ; as for principle, it was not what the Court wanted, and in point of attachment they thought themselves on many accounts perfectly sure of him. The papers which were laid before Parliament and published, sufficiently prove how much they were mistaken; the papers which were withheld from Parliament and remain in the office, prove still more strongly Lord George�s incapacity. He endured every species of indignity, from Sir Guy Carleton particularly, and other officers with whom he was obliged to correspond. There was a general diffidence as to his honour, and a general disrespect for his person, which was greatly heightened by the treatment he underwent in the House of Commons and the poor figure he made there. He sent out the greatest force which this country ever assembled, both of land and sea forces, which together perhaps exceeded the greatest effort ever made by any nation, considering the distance and all other circumstances, but was totally unable to combine the operations of the war, much less to form any general plan for bringing about a reconciliation. The best plan which was formed in the office was one which was given in by General Arnold. The inconsistent orders given to Generals Howe and Burgoyne could not be accounted for except in a way which it must be difficult for any person who is not conversant with the negligence of office to comprehend.
Among many singularities he had a particular aversion to being put out of his way on any occasion; he had fixed to go into Kent or Northamptonshire at a particular hour, and to call on his way at his office to sign the dispatches, all of which had been settled, to both these Generals. By some mistake those to General Howe were not fair copied, and upon his growing impatient at it, the office, which was a very idle one, promised to send it to the country after him, while they dispatched the others to General Burgoyne, expecting that the others could be expedited before the packet sailed with the first, which, however, by some mistake sailed without them, and the wind detained the vessel which was ordered to carry the rest. Hence came General Burgoyne�s defeat, the French declaration, and the loss of thirteen Colonies. It might appear incredible if his own Secretary and the most respectable persons in office had not assured me of the fact; what corroborates it, is that it can be accounted for no other way. It requires as much experience in business to comprehend the very trifling causes which have produced the greatest events, as it does strength of reason to develop the deepest design.
The capture of Lord Cornwallis and his army united the whole Kingdom in one opinion of the impracticability of the War and the incapacity of the Minister who conducted it. Lord George was obliged to retire from office, but did it under cover of a Peerage, which gave occasion to an unprecedented motion and debate in the House of Lords, which for the sake of the Crown and its prerogative, as well as for the honour of the Peerage, it is to be hoped will never be again provoked under this or any future reign. The character he left in his office was that of a man violent, sanguine, and overbearing in the first conception and setting out of plans, but easily checked and liable to sink into an excess of despondency upon the least reverse without any sort of resource. The persons he brought into office were all, except his Principal Secretary, Mr. Doyley (who came about him I don�t know by what accident), of a very obscure description, more or less of adventurers, of doubtful morals, and worse than doubtful integrity; but what disgraced him most of all, was his inveterate habit of corruption. He was not content with obtaining for his sons reversions of offices to a considerable amount, which ought to be executed by resident and capable persons and have since that time become the subject of an express Act of Parliament, but he made the most of almost everything he had to give, particularly of the Governments in the West Indies, and that in a moment when it was of the utmost consequence to choose men of the highest eminence and character for those important trusts. This was notorious from the character of those he appointed, some of whom had no previous connection with him, and others a very low one; but there are not wanting such proofs of what passed as leave it out of all manner of doubt. The chief plans which he left in the office turn upon confiscations; and a total change in the mode of governing the Colonies, which it would have been folly to have attempted in the quietest times. His conversation to the officers going out, went entirely upon forfeitures and every species of severity.
The last public act of his life was a perfect epitome of all the rest, which was his opposition to the Irish propositions after his conduct in Ireland and his failure in the management of American affairs; not to mention a variety of other disadvantageous circumstances under which he stood in the House of Lords. It was a proof of no small effrontery and presumption to commence prophet afresh, and revive principles of high Government which had cost us so much and so lately too. He likewise showed no small address in refraining from speaking, while there was anybody present who was likely to answer him with any degree of point. He judged perfectly well the state of parties and the character of Ministry, and by means of indirect support which he received from different sides from different motives, and having had no reply made him, he contrived to make an impression which gave him a degree of momentary �clat; and would if he had lived have probably procured the object he had immediately in view, of obtaining some distinction for a son-in-law, who consented to take back his daughter under very base and dishonourable circumstances, and of forwarding lines of secret intrigue, which no man studied more, and giving vent to his general principles of policy and government. Upon the whole, his life deserves to be recorded as exhibiting more striking examples of the effects of good and bad fortune than has hitherto happened in our time.
He owed such success as he met with in life, to his birth, the gravity of his manner, a naturally clear understanding, which prevented his taking up any argument in private, and still less in public, of which he was not complete master, but above all to his talent for imposition of every kind but one. As most men when they are content to apply their mind only to one thing, gain a wonderful tact in it, and especially when it regards manner only, he attained a very great faculty of judging both of parties and men, and turning both to what was always uppermost in his mind, his general line of imposition. He had no desire of searching out truth, he had no scruples, no management for any friends; was used to content himself with taking up the corner of an argument upon which he used to declaim with great decision and a great deal of seeming force, and for the most part judged both his time and place admirably well. Next to himself he owed his consideration to his mother�s country; he erected a Scotch Standard which always stuck to him, and his Westminster connection never failed to advise and support him underhand, even when he was most pressed. But he wanted judgment in all great affairs, and he wanted heart on every occasion. He neither knew mankind nor did he know himself : the first is sufficiently proved by his never having had a creditable connection; the second by his putting himself repeatedly in situations in which he could not acquit himself, and putting himself forward in a manner both revolting and unbecoming, which no wise man would have ventured. He had likewise a great want of secrecy, naturally enough a part of the same character and to be accounted for on the same principles.
He might be considered as an object of pity for some of his other failings, but what should deprive him of any and must stain his character for evermore, was his intolerable meanness and love of corruption, which he could not resist even when he enjoyed an ample fortune, and it might be supposed could want nothing to die in peace with his own mind but to retrieve his character or to leave his family but a good name. If he had had the smallest spark of elevation within him, the distresses of his country, the part which he was called upon to act, and the height which it might be supposed he had in view, would have excited it.
