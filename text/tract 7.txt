Our Lord was so far from denying the truth of the consequential Doctrine, which the Jews had drawn from his having said, that �God was his Father, his own proper Father,� that he immediately, in the very next verse, appealed to his works for the truth of it! This is so necessary a part of the Christian Duty, that men cannot pay the proper honour to THE HEAVENLY FATHER, unless they thus honour THE SON, also, with supreme Honour; for)
The Scriptures attribute Eternal Honour and Glory to THE SON, and that jointly with THE HEAVENLY FATHER.
Thus we find, that �HONOUR, and GLORY, and POWER,� belong �UNTO THE LAMB FOR EVER!� He had indeed, for a time, laid aside this SUPREME GLORY (this Glory which is attributed to him jointly with him that sitteth upon the Heavenly Throne) that he might become �the Son of Man,� and �by Obedience in fulfilling the Law,� and �all Righteousness,� even as A MAN, might retrieve the dignity and lost privileges of HUMAN NATURE: but the Divine Glory was again to be restored to him, though he now partook of the Nature of his Creature Man; nay, the Son himself, even when a Man, claims the Glory of his Heavenly Father! 
It was not only in his Divine Nature, that THE SON was to be thus glorified, but expressly as �Man;� so that the Nature of MAN is indeed exalted in Christ to the highest pitch of glory! The throne or kingdom here promised, was also to be an everlasting Kingdom, though given to Christ, expressly as �Son of Man;� for it is certainly the same Kingdom foretold by the Prophet Daniel-Compare this with chap. ii. 44. wherein the same Prophet informs us that-The Psalmist had also previously declared-�Thy Throne, O GOD, is FOR EVER AND EVER.� Which the Apostle Paul has applied expressly to the Son. Heb. i. 8. These Prophecies of an Eternal Kingdom, proclaimed by the Prophets under the Old Testament, were confirmed by the Angel GABRIEL, when he declared the Eternity of CHRIST�S Government. The two last-mentioned texts, when collated with the preceding declarations concerning the Eternity of Christ�s Kingdom, would contain an irreconcilable difficulty, were it not clearly demonstrable, that �the Son of God� is really included with THE ALMIGHTY FATHER in the Eternal BEING JEHOVAH, and consequently is truly GOD! For the fact is, that he is called JEHOVAH and GOD in many unquestionable passages of Scripture, in some expressly, in others by necessary implication, (several examples of which are already cited in this Tract) and no inference to the contrary can be justly drawn from any of the texts which my learned friend (before mentioned) has laid before me as proofs of an opposite sentiment!
These prove, indeed, that he is �inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood,� and all of them demonstrate his subordination to the Almighty Father in the ministry and gracious offices which he had undertaken for the restoration of mankind; but none of them afford the least shadow of contradiction to the texts wherein his Divine Nature is declared! One particular text, however, remains to be mentioned, which, at first sight, seems to militate against my general argument-viz. Psalm lxxxiii. 18-Now, it is strictly true, indeed, (though I do not think it the proper translation of this text) that God ALONE is JEHOVAH, because Jehovah alone is God; and the Scriptures assure us, that there is but ONE JEHOVAH, or One �ONLY WISE GOD�. And therefore, when the Son of God is called JEHOVAH, or GOD, he is not so named, as being distinct or separate with respect to that ONE Eternal Being, JEHOVAH, or GOD, but as being included in the Divine Nature, or God, �whose Name alone is JEHOVAH,� and as being ONE with the ALMIGHTY FATHER! which was declared by the Son himself.
This opens to us the time that Christ will deliver up the kingdom. DEATH, that last enemy, will be effectually destroyed, when all men, that are redeemed by Christ, are risen from DEATH! The world itself (where alone Death reigned) and all that is desirable in it, will then not only be �burned up,� but will be made the seat of eternal Horror and �everlasting Fire,� and the irrevocable decrees of the Son of MAN, in his final judgment upon MEN and ANGELS, will by that time have taken place! Here, then, is an end of the whole Christian Dispensation! What need can there be of a Redeemer, a Mediator, or of a Judge, after the Fate of all Mankind is determined!-It is no lessening, therefore, of the Son�s Dignity, that he then delivers up the several charges which he had undertaken in obedience to his Father�s will, when the same shall have been completely executed and fulfilled!-The generality of Commentators agree, that it is Christ�s Mediatorial Kingdom, which will then be delivered up; but they should also have mentioned that Sovereignty, which is still of higher degree, that glorious Sovereign Authority, which is of unspeakable Dignity; I mean that of sitting as SUPREME JUDGE OF THE UNIVERSE! An authority of which even the Almighty Father hath divested himself. Nay, not only Men, but Angels must honour him; for the word ALL includes Angels as well as Men; and we read expressly, that Angels are required to WORSHIP HIM, which would be gross idolatry, if Christ was not truly GOD, and One with the Father in the Eternal Being JEHOVAH! And when the important Trust shall have been fulfilled, and completely executed, that Divine Authority and Jurisdiction as supreme Judge (which had been committed only to One of the Divine Persons) shall be delivered up, together with all other offices of distinct or separate Authority-Agreeably to the Angel�s Prophecy.
The Scriptures indeed are every where filled with clear Testimonies concerning the Divinity of our BLESSED REDEEMER, so that the command to honour him, �even as we honour the Father,� is perfectly consistent with all the rest. And therefore, unless we HONOUR the Son with SUPREME HONOUR, �even as we honour the Father,� we fall short of the command; and, for want of due Faith, cannot expect to obtain of the Father that glorious and heavenly Gift for the necessary improvement of Human Nature, which our REDEEMER has promised. 
The supreme, or equal Divine Nature of THE HOLY SPIRIT, is not less clearly declared, in several parts of Scripture, than the Divine Nature, of THE SON OF GOD, notwithstanding that some other parts of Scripture express a manifest Subordination of Office; and that he is sent or given by the Father; and also by the Son; and again, that he is declared to be �the Spirit of Christ,� as well as �the Spirit of God!�-yet (I say, notwithstanding these expressions of Subordination) the supreme or equal Divine Nature of THE HOLY SPIRIT is clearly revealed in several parts of Scripture. The Prophet Isaiah, for instance, had declared the Divine Omnipotence of the Spirit in the strongest terms;-in terms which prove, that �the Spirit of God� is a free and independent Spirit, and is truly God of the same supreme Divine Nature, or Eternal being, with the other Two Divine Persons; for this Prophet expressly applies to �the Spirit of God� the same supreme Attributes of Creation and Almighty Power, which in other parts of Scripture are occasionally attributed to the other Two Divine Persons!
But hear the words of the Prophet himself, dictated by that same Spirit.-The Prophet afterwards proceeds to speak of God without further distinction of Persons, having already, in the preceding part of the chapter, clearly distinguished the Person of the Son of God under the title of �Jehovah,� and �our God,� whose Advent was to be proclaimed by the voice in the wilderness, and of whom Sion and Jersualem were directed to say unto the cities of Judah, �Behold your God,� and having also expressly distinguished �the Spirit of Jehovah,� and proclaimed his Divine Attributes and supreme Dignity, he now proceeds to speak of GOD (in the 18th verse) without further distinction of Persons. 
The Spiritual Nature of GOD is surely so far above our finite comprehension, that it cannot be explained or expressed by any likeness or comparison whatsoever!-But yet, as we may clearly perceive and understand, by what is revealed to us, that the supreme Attributes of Creation and Almighty Power are applied expressly to the Holy Spirit (as in the above cited text of Isaiah) which in other parts of Scripture are equally attributed to THE FATHER AND THE SON, we may reasonably conclude, that the supreme Dignity of the HOLY SPIRIT must necessarily consist in his entire Union and Equality with the Father and with the Son in the Divine Nature, or GODHEAD, -that ONE eternal and glorious Being, JEHOVAH.
This entire Union of THE HOLY SPIRIT with the Almighty Father and the Son, in the One Eternal Being of GOD, is a necessary doctrine, without which THE ALMIGHTY POWER, attributed in the Scriptures to the Holy Spirit, cannot be reconciled to that other indispensable Article of our Faith, the Unity of God!
In the Book of Job the Spirit is declared to be the Creator! And the Psalmist attributes the Creation to THE SPIRIT jointly with the Divine WORD; And afterwards, when the Divine WORD was made flesh and dwelt among us, he himself expressly attributed to �the Spirit of God� those mighty WORKS, to which he appealed for the truth of his doctrine concerning his Unity with the Almighty Father (see p. 298.) and which, at another time, he expressly calls the Works of his Father! So that without the doctrine of the Unity of the Divine Nature, this application of the same Attributes to different Persons could not be understood!
St. Paul also attributed to �THE POWER OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD� the miracles, which he wrought �through Jesus Christ,� in preaching his Gospel to the Gentiles. Nay, even the miraculous Conception of the Blessed Virgin (from whence the Holy Child Jesus was called �the Son of God�) is expressly attributed to the Holy Ghost by St. Matthew.
The glorious Title �the Power of the Highest,� which immediately follows these words concerning the Holy Ghost in the last-mentioned text, is by several learned Commentators attributed also to him, viz. the Holy Spirit; and a Title nearly similar is certainly attributed to the same Spirit, even by our Lord himself, when he foretold the fulfilling of God�s promise in the Gift of the Holy Ghost. 
Similar Titles are also given to the Son of God; for even in his ministerial Character as Messiah, or Christ, after he had taken Human Nature upon him, he is called �THE POWER OF GOD AND THE WISDOM OF GOD,� Surely these are Attributes of the Divine Being, and Titles of supreme Dignity!
The Power of Justification must certainly be also accounted a Divine Attribute, and as such can belong to none but God; �for it is GOD that JUSTIFIETH� but yet both Justification, and Sanctification also, (another Divine Attribute) are expressly attributed to the HOLY SPIRIT, jointly with CHRIST!
To give Life, also, is not less apparently an Attribute of THE DIVINE BEING than Creation, whether we speak of mere Animal Life, or the Spiritual or Eternal Life, but more especially the latter, and yet this ALMIGHTY POWER is attributed both to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit! In consequence of this Almighty Power the Son is called �THE PRINCE (or Author) OF LIFE, and the Spirit is expressly intituled - �the Spirit of LIFE.�
These expressions of Dignity and Power are unlimited, and do certainly include the highest or supreme degree of the several recited Attributes, even the infinite Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, &c. of GOD, because they are attibuted to that glorious Spirit, which �searcheth all things, yeah, the deep things of God!� and they are attributed to him, also, as essential. Properties, which are so eminently his, that he is even named from them.
These Titles and Attributes cannot (in that eminent and essential degree in which they are attributed both to the Son and Holy Spirit) belong to any Being that is not truly God, and Jehovah: and it is clearly revealed to us, that there is but One Jehovah, who is the only true God; the God of Israel; and yet we learn by the Scriptures, not only that CHRIST is truly GOD, and JEHOVAH (of which I have already produced many authentic proofs from Scripture) but that THE HOLY GHOSt is also JEHOVAH, and consequently is included likewise in the Unity of the Deity or Godhead!
The Holy Ghost is Jehovah, because it is he who. Surely these are expressions of supreme Authority, which could not be used by any Spirit that was not truly Jehovah!
Thus, the being taught of God, is manifestly esteemed by our Lord to be the same thing as hearing and learning of the Father, for he mentions these circumstances apparently to illustrate what he had before said (in the preceding verse) concerning the Father�s drawing the true Believers so that Christ�s reference to what was �written in the Prophets� on this subject (especially as he applies these Prophecies to the Drawing and Teaching of the Father) seems, at first sight, to make against my argument, which was to show, that the Prophecies here cited were the Words of THE HOLY GHOST, speaking in the Prophets under the Title of Jehovah! But this is so far from being a real objection, that it is truly a confirmation of the former argument concerning the speaking of THE HOLY GHOST, when we consider, that the Drawing of the Father, and the Teaching of God, is effected only by the Spirit of God! For the same Apostle (John), who recorded our Lord�s reference to the Prophets last cited, tells us in his First General Epistle how this Teaching of God is communicated. This Unction or Anointing, is generally understood by Commentators to signify the Influence of the Holy Spirit, and the Effect of that Influence is further explained in the 27th verse of the same chapter. And it is manifest, that this �Anointing, which teacheth all things,� is to be understood of THE HOLY SPIRIT; for the Apostle Paul informs us, that the Communication of this Knowledge or Teaching from God is by the Holy Spirit.
The glorious Effect of Christ�s Promises upon those who duly claim them, is principally that we shall �partake of the Divine Nature!� But how can that Effect take place, if the Spirit of God, and of Christ, the Spirit of the Father, and of the Son, by which alone we can have communication with either, is not really Divine? We are taught by a multitude of texts throughout the New Testament, that MAN by Nature is capable of receiving THE HOLY SPIRIT within him; so that the Human Body is expressly called in Scripture �the Temple of the Holy Ghost;� and therefore, if THE HOLY GHOST were not really and truly GOD, of the same Divine Nature with THE FATHER (for there can be but ONE Divine Nature, as there is but ONE GOD, which I hope is already clearly demonstrated) how improper would be the idea of comparing Man to a Temple? For Christians are not only called �the Temple of God, but expressly (as I have already remarked) the Temple of the Holy Ghost,� as if the terms were synonymous!
Too many Temples, indeed, through the Depravity of Mankind, and the Influence of Devils, have been dedicated to those, �which by Nature are NO GODS!� But that was only amongst men-�who knew not God.� But shall we conceive of the inspired Writers of the New Testament, that they would also DEDICATE Temples to a Being, �which by Nature is no God!�  For if we could suppose it true, that THE HOLY SPIRIT �by Nature is no GOD,� the TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST would be no better, in that one respect, than Heathen Temples! And therefore, if we really believe the Holy Scriptures to be the Word of God, we must necessarily believe that THE HOLY GHOST is really and truly God; for otherwise we should not have been required by the Holy Scriptures to esteem our Bodies as the �Temple of the Holy Ghost!� And as it thus appears to be a necessary conclusion, that THE HOLY GHOST is truly GOD, it is equally a necessary doctrine, that he is also JEHOVAH-�For who is GOD� (i.e. truly God) �except JEHOVAH?� And therefore, though THE HOLY GHOST is clearly revealed to us in Scripture as a distinct Person from THE FATHER and THE SON, he must nevertheless be included in that One Divine and Eternal Being, JEHOVAH; and accordingly, in that supreme character, he revealed the Divine Will to the Prophets! Of this I have already produced some remarkable, and (I trust) incontrovertible proofs, and therefore shall only request my reader�s attention to one more example of it. &c. But when we turn to that part of Isaiah�s Prophecy to which the Apostle refers us, as the SAYING of THE HOLY GHOST, we find it was JEHOVAH which spoke to the Prophet!
Now the Lord, or Adoni, who then spake to Isaiah, was represented to the Prophet
Now, notwithstanding that the Lord JEHOVAH is represented in this Divine Revelation as speaking in the Plural Number (�who will go for us�), and that the threefold repetition of the Epithet Holy, in the proclamation of God�s glorious Title, Jehovah of Hosts, seems to correspond with the above-mentioned Idea of a Plurality of Persons being comprehended in that One Eternal Being, JEHOVAH, which then revealed himself to Isaiah, yet the Apostle Paul expressly attributed the Revelation to the Holy Ghost, as being the Divine Person which then spake! Who then shall presume to say that THE HOLY GHOST is not really and truly GOD; when it is apparent, by the citations already made, that the glorious Name JEHOVAH, which includes THE DIVINE NATURE OF THE FATHER, and OF THE SON, is expressly attributed also to THE HOLY GHOST?
Without a due sense of this supreme Dignity of the Holy Spirit, we should form but a very unworthy idea of the real Dignity of HUMAN NATURE, which (as I have already shown) is not only capable of receiving the Gift, or internal Communication, of that glorious and eternal FREE SPIRIT OF GOD, as a Principle of Action, but it is also clearly entitled even to claim that wonderful participation of the Divine Nature!-to claim it, I say, by a written Charter of Privileges, which can never be taken from us (as God�s Word cannot fail), he having bound himself to us, on certain reciprocal conditions, by an irrevocable covenant (as sure as his Word) that MAN might be FREE indeed! We are FREE (I say) having now a free Choice, through Chris, to partake, if we will of the Tree of Life, from which our first Parents were unhappily excluded in this world! But these glorious Privileges being granted to Human Nature only through the Merits of that �Son of Man,� who voluntarily took our Nature upon him, we must always remember, that our Title to the Benefits of the free Covenant, before mentioned, is valid only when claimed in his Name, and for his Sake, as we ourselves are otherwise totally unworthy of them;
He hath, therefore, particularly instructed us how to claim the Privileges of Human Nature, assuring us by reiterated Promises, tendered in the most urgent and effectionate manner, that Prayers in his Name shall certainly be effectual; that is, provided there be no willful Defect on our part; which conditional Clause is always to be understood, wherever Promises of Blessings are delivered in Holy Scripture.
Nature is capable of being invested �after the sufferings of this present time,� as signified by the same Apostle in a parallel passage of another Epistle. This further Revelation of God�s Will [variously expressed in the New Testament,] concerning the sure and most certain expectation, that we may entertain, of being invested with ETERNAL GLORLY in the world to come, (if we persevere in the true Faith and Practice of Christianity in this world), completes our Charter of Privileges and Immunities, or, �the perfect Law of Liberty,� which THE ALMIGHTY has been pleased to tender to his Creature Man!
Here is a noble declaration of that �perfect Liberty,� to which Christ has restored mankind! that glorious Dignity of �Human Nature,� which even the poorest and meanest persons amongst us (the distressed, the hungry, and the naked) are capable of attaining by Perseverance, in Faith, and Resolution in observing and keeping, on their Part, THE CONDITIONS of our reciprocal Covenant with God!
Let us therefore (like the Apostle) approach unto the Throne of Grace, in full Assurance of FAITH, always remembering, that a SOUND FAITH must be the principal Foundation of our Pretensions to the promised Dignity and Privileges of HUMAN NATURE, and that by Perseverance in the true Faith, and a continual Renewal of those inestimable Claims, for time to time, while we remain in this world, we may be as confident as the Apostle, that because, through him, God has put it absolutely in our own Power (whatever our temporary Afflictions and Sufferings may be in this Life) to attain an being fully persuaded that he, who PROMISED, is �able also to PERFORM.�
The Defects of this Tract, wherever the Reader discovers any, are certainly to be attributed to the fallible Author, whose Name is prefixed; but whatever may seem praise-worthy, and instructive therein, to GOD ALONE!
