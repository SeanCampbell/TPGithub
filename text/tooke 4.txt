TO MR. JOHN WILKES.
WHILST you were candidate for the city of London, a subscription was opened on the 19th of March, 1768, at Lee and Ayton's, the bankers, for the payment of your debts: the trustees for which were Messrs. John Mills, Samuel Vaughan, Richard Oliver, Lewis Mendez, George Hayley. These and a few
other gentlemen subscribed very liberally, and great expectations were formed of its probable produce; but the public cannot be said to have contributed. This backwardness was supposed to proceed from an apprehension that the subscription would not be applied to the payment of your debts, but to support your election; the usefulness of which was not at that time generally understood. To obviate this objection, a promise was made by the trustees, that no part of this subscription should be applied to election purposes; the public were still backward to subscribe; and the whole amount of the subscription from March 19, 1768, to February 20, 1769, was 1,116�. 7s. 7d. � Your debts were at this time sup- posed to amount to about 6000�. � Two shillings and sixpence in the pound were therefore offered to such as would accept a composition; with a promise, that, if the dividend should be greater, they who accepted the two shillings and sixpence should receive their proportion. As fast as something was paid, something was likewise added daily to the list of your debts; and, instead of increasing the dividend, it was discovered that two shillings and sixpence was more than could be paid. Your best friends, even those who were most able and generous, despaired of the possibility of extricating you. Another subscription was, however, opened by a few gentlemen, (almost all the same,) for your election expenses: this latter subscription amounted to 1,227�. 3s. You were chosen for the county of Middlesex; and soon after, in this desperate situation of your private affairs, were sentenced to two years imprisonment, and two fines of one thousand pounds. Privilege gave some respite from your debts; but, notwithstanding this and the generosity of individuals, (many of whom exerted themselves in presents to you much beyond their stations in life,) it was found exceedingly difficult to furnish you even a daily support. Most of those who were so generous to you at that time, have since been the objects of your bitterest resentment. The best method then found for a little knot of public-spirited men, (who bore the whole burden with very unequal force, drained as they were by subscriptions and expenses,) to procure you a necessary subsistence, was, to have very frequent meetings at the King's Arms Tavern, in Cornhill; where each paid a little more than his share of the reckoning, and, when the over plus amounted to about ten pounds, it was regularly sent to you.
Never, surely was a great public cause so overlaid with the wickedness and folly of an individual as the present! Every day brought fresh difficulties and disgrace on Mr. Wilkes; and yet he was the only person who, all the while, felt no distress, denied himself no expense, was neither sensible nor apprehensive of any disgrace. The just abhorrence of Mr. Wilkes, as a private man, kept many good men at a distance from the cause of the people, which was unhappily blended with his personal persecution: the friends of that cause were therefore anxious to cover, if possible, or to lessen the infamy, of which he was careless. The breach of trust committed by him towards the Foundling Hospital began to make a noise; being found, upon inquiry, to be too true, it demanded their earliest attention. Two gentlemen immediately advanced three hundred pounds to the hospital, and engaged themselves to pay the remainder. The whole sum due from Mr. Wilkes to the Foundling Hospital amounted to 990�. Is. 3d.
Whilst matters were in this situation, and every day growing worse, you were unjustly expelled from the house of commons; and that expulsion was the cause of the society at the London Tavern.
Many gentlemen, unconnected with each other, had long been wishing for some association to be set on foot for public purposes, and it had been much talked of as a measure capable of producing great benefit to the public: the present seemed a proper moment for it, and it was proposed by Mr. Townsend instantly to begin.
When first I knew that gentleman, he was determined (though warm in the public cause) never to have any connexion or intercourse with Mr. Wilkes, whose character he knew too well not to detest. But when the house of commons rejected the material part of your petition, and were determined unjustly to expel you, in order by stripping you of privilege to leave you a perpetual prisoner in the King's Bench for debt, (since lord Mansfield had not dared, as he endeavoured, to imprison you for life, by means of the outlawry,) Mr. Townsend then consented that I should introduce him to you; and he spoke to you for the first time in the committee-room of the house of commons, when they voted your petition to be false, groundless, 8$c. And Mr. Townsend did this to let the ministry understand that they would gain nothing by injustice; but would so far attach to the cause even those who most heartily despised the man, as to rescue you even from the legal consequences of an illegal 'persecution.
You were expelled on the 3d of February, 1769, and rechosen on the 16th of the same month: your election was declared void on the l7th, and yourself voted incapable of being elected into the present parliament. 
The ministry had now every reason to believe, that, by keeping you out of the house, they should for ever confine you in a jail: they knew that a subscription had been opened for you on the 19th of March, 1768, when your debts were said to amount only to 6000�.; and they could not be ignorant, that this subscription produced only 1116�. 7s.-1d. The amount of your debts was now increased, and said to be about 14,000�. Add to this, that there were two fines of 1000�. to be paid; and, besides the expenses of repeated elections, support was to be provided for you during two years in prison. To extricate you from such difficulties seemed impossible, not only to ministry, but even to those who were most able and willing to contribute. In this situation the establishment of a society was proposed: the plan was formed and executed in great haste: Mr. Sawbridge and Mr. Townsend laboured at one end of the town, whilst some persons were employed at the other, to give a general notice of the design, and to collect as many respectable persons as possible, whose sentiments and wishes were known to be public. On the 20th of February, 1769, only three days after the vote of incapacitation, the first meeting of the society was held at the London Tavern: a subscription was immediately made by the gentlemen present, which amounted to 3023�.�A second meeting was held five days afterwards, on the 25th of the same month, when they assumed the name of Supporters of the Bill of Rights. A very worthy member of the house of commons proposed that name as most expressive of the public intentions of the society, which disdained the notion of being merely a club for Mr. Wilkes, of whom the greater part had a very bad opinion. Still further to avoid any such imputation, it was at this second meeting resolved, that Mr. Wilkes�s health should never be given in that society as a public toast; and this resolution has been uniformly observed: still further to avoid misapprehension, the society desired me to draw up an advertisement, which should declare their purposes to the public.
At the third meeting of the society, March 7, (only three weeks after the first), three hundred pounds were given to Mr. Wilkes, and a committee was appointed with the treasurers to inquire into the several demands upon Mr. Wilkes.
At the ninth meeting of the society, June 6, (only fifteen weeks from its first establishment,) it appeared that 4553�. had been expended in the composition of debts, &c. for Mr. Wilkes; and a further sum of 2500�. Was ordered to be issued by the treasurers for the further discharge of Mr. Wilkes's debts during the summer. After which, and a vote of 300�. more to Mr. Wilkes, the society adjourned to the 10th of October following. Any man, who reads this account, will naturally suppose, that Mr. Wilkes must have felt and expressed the warmest gratitude to a society like this, which, in so short a time, had performed such wonders in his favour. Whoever shall suppose so, will be much mistaken: he abhorred the society and its members. The declarations of the most respectable part, disclaiming a personal attachment to Mr. Wilkes, and professing only a regard to the public, disgusted him extremely, the resolution that his health should never be given as a public toast in that society, and the advertisement of supporting him and his cause only as far as it was a public cause, were never forgiven. Besides, he entertained a false notion, that, had not this society been instituted, he should himself have received all the ready money subscribed by the society into his own hands; what they applied to the discharge of his debts, he considered as a kind of robbery; and hated them for their care of him, as profligate young heirs do the guardians who endeavour to save them from destruction. Add to this an apprehension lest the society should gain the public confidence; and, not being his creatures, should hereafter be strong enough to oppose effectually the extravagant foolish notions he had formed of his own greatness; merely to be protected does not answer his expectations; improbable as it may appear, he dreams of nothing less than of being himself protector. He therefore, from its very institution, determined the destruction of the society; because he knew they meant not only the king and the laws, � but the king according to the laws. My industry and zeal for a society capable of so much future good, as well as the sincerity with which I always spoke disagreeable truths to Mr. Wilkes, entitled me to a considerable share of his resentment. I had not only drawn up the offensive advertisement, but at all times warmly combated those few of his inconsiderate partisans who were constantly endeavouring to narrow the society, and convert us only to a sponge, which would suck up the generosity of the public, to be squeezed into his pocket. The lack-laughter sangfroid of the parson was the constant topic of his ridicule, and he complained, that, whenever I appeared, I cast a gloom over the mirth of his company. His disposition towards the society was not altered for the better by the frequent remonstrances I made to him, at the repeated request of many of his most generous subscribers, who were much dissatisfied at his laced liveries and his French servants in his situation; whom no motives of policy, or honesty, or shame, have hitherto made him discard.
To cover the real causes of his dissatisfaction, Mr. Wilkes pretended to take it much amiss that the society should mention his debts in their advertisement; as if there was any secret in the matter; and he seized the first opportunity to complain of it as an indignity offered to him; forgetting that he had himself long before published a very abject advertisement, pretending to return thanks to his generous benefactor for the kind donation of an hundred pounds; but really to excite the compassion of the charitable. 
The society continued to make great progress in the affairs of Mr. Wilkes; though, it must be confessed, with very little assistance from the public at large, out of the society. They had paid all his election expenses, and one of his fines of 500�.; they had compounded a very considerable portion of his debts; when on the 24th of October, they voted him 300�. more, making in the whole 1000�. for his
pocket.
A few weeks after this vote, Mr. Wilkes obtained a verdict against lord Halifax, with 4000�. damages: I waited on Mr. Wilkes, and endeavoured to persuade him that he was bound in honour, in honesty, and policy, to send these 4000�. to the London Tavern, in aid towards the payment of his debts: I represented to him the poverty of our bank, which had, indeed, advanced too far, and was in debt; I endeavoured to make him sensible that 4000�., at that time, would go further in compounding his debts, than 10,000�. Would some time afterwards: I showed him the reputation he would gain, by this act of common honesty and policy, and that he would encourage the public to subscribe towards him, and bind the gentlemen of the society in honour never to quit him till they had at least returned him his 4000�., though it was employed in the discharge of his own debts. I laboured in vain: ready cash made Mr. Wilkes deaf to my arguments. He would not send a penny to the society, for the discharge of his own debts, though it was not many weeks since the society had, in one year, voted him the last part of a thousand pounds for his support.
Whilst these things were in agitation, the society, on the 8th of February, 1770, receiveda letter from the Commons House of Assembly of South Carolina, with a subscription of 1000�. In this situation were the affairs of the society, when you came out of the King's Bench, on the 17th of April, 1770, only fourteen months since its first establishment. Your election expenses of 2973�. were paid; � your two fines of 1000�. were discharged; � 12,000�. of your debts were compounded; � you had a thousand pounds from the society, besides all the private presents you received; � you reserved to yourself the four thousand pounds recovered from lord Halifax; � and there remained only 6,821�. 13s. to be compounded of your debts.
In my next, I will proceed to show the return you made to the society and the public for these obligations; from which may easily be collected your gratitude to the one, and your regard for the other.
John Horne.
TO MR. JOHN WILKES.
ON the 17th of April, 1770, Mr. Wilkes was released from the King's Bench prison; and at the next meeting of the society, April 24, he was proposed to be ballotted for as a member; and, at the following meeting, May 8, was unanimously chosen. 
It is proper I should now mention what was Mr. Wilkes's visible situation. He had an estate of 700�. a year, out of which 200�. A year was payable to Mrs. Wilkes, and an annuity of 150�. was due to Mr. Reynolds, he having purchased the same for 1000�.; so that there remained to Mr. Wilkes a nominal 350�. a year. Besides this income, Mr. Wilkes had 2000�. in ready money; the other 2000�. of the sum recovered from lord Halifax, were said to be paid to Mr. Reynolds, i. e. 1200�. for Mr. Reynolds's law-charges, &c., and 800�. to discharge some debts contracted by another breach of trust towards the Buckinghamshire militia, when Mr. Wilkes was their colonel. On this foundation, that is, with a nominal 350�. a year, and 2000�. ready money, but with a drawback of 6,821�. declared debts, Mr. Wilkes (whilst he was still in the King's Bench, with many detainers lodged against him, and before he could tell whether the society, notwithstanding all their zeal, would be able to compass his enlargement) entered into treaty with sir Edward Astley for his dwelling-house in Great George Street. The terms were easily agreed to, and nothing stood in the way but security; sir Edward desired security. Mr. Wilkes, who had as lief he had put ratsbane in his mouth, and who knew that, though I could not laugh at his jest, I could sometimes do his business, was desirous to turn over to me the employment of procuring security, such gloomy matters being, as he had experienced, perfectly suited to my disposition. I was too dull to taste the pleasantry of such an arrangement. Mr. Reynolds had bought in the annuity of 150�. merely to give Mr. Wilkes an opportunity to repurchase it; and I thought one of his thousands, if he would not lend them for the discharge of his debts, would be more usefully employed that way than in furniture: I represented to him that, having a thousand pounds, and not repurchasing the annuity, he did, in fact, at that moment, sell 150�. a year for a thousand pounds ready money. I bestowed the freest terms on the dishonesty, ingratitude, and folly, of thus laying a plan to replunge himself in debt, after all the hard struggles which had been made to rescue him. I refused sharply to be instrumental in a measure, which must necessarily have one of these two consequences; either that Mr. Wilkes must soon return to prison a beggar, and so defeat, in, some measure, all that had been done for him; or that all the money which the public spirit of individuals could supply, must, to the exclusion of all public purposes, be confined to the support of his private extravagance. The former of these consequences would be very detrimental to the public cause, the latter would be fatal. I was not singular in my opinion on this subject; all the gentlemen to whom Mr. Wilkes applied, even the future chamberlain and town-clerk, refused to be security. Though Mr. Wilkes was disappointed of a large house, he was determined not to lose the opportunity of a large expense. On quitting the King's Bench prison he took a house on a lease at fifty pounds a year, that he might layout some hundreds on its repairs: at the same time he took a country house at sixty guineas for the season; and, to complete his plan of economy, he sent his daughter to Paris, to see the Dauphin s wedding, whilst himself was all the summer making the tour of the watering places. That his generous supporters might not be too much ridiculed, he kept no more than six domestics; and that his politeness and gratitude to his country might keep pace with his economy, only three of them were French.
Such were the situations of Mr. Wilkes and of the society when he was released from prison. Those who had hitherto laboured so indefatigably did not remit their diligence. In order to keep the promises of the society, and do good to the public, it was necessary that they should at length come to some conclusion of Mr. Wilkes's private affairs. They could easily see, that, if they did not make haste, Mr. Wilkes would incur fresh debts faster that they could discharge the old: it was proper that he should know what he had to expect from the society; and they could not begin to procure for him a reasonable annuity till
they had first cleared his incumbrances. It was the wish of all those with whom I ever conversed to set him free, and afterwards to procure for him a clear annuity of six hundred pounds. Having done so, to cease subscriptions for the further support of Mr. Wilkes, unless some new public reason should make it justifiable, and to apply the whole collected strength of the public to the most important public measures that should need pecuniary assistance. Whatever difficulties the future private extravagance of Mr. Wilkes might bring upon him, the society did not consider as any object of their concern. The public spirit of the nation would be justified by what they had done for him and sufficient encouragement would thereby be given to all other private men to do their duty, and a sufficient lesson to kings and ministers to abstain from violence and injustice. These purposes I did not doubt to see fulfilled before the month of March, 1771. And I was foolish enough to suppose, that Mr.Wilkes would not dare to appear discontented, if (after three whole years of such successful labour applied to his private affairs, himself freed from his debts, and with clear six hundred pounds a year, the society still supporting the expense of all public measures) we employed our strength at last on other important objects of public advantage. With these aims, and a corresponding conduct, without ever having received the slightest favour from any party or great man in administration or opposition, I could not foresee that, by all my labour, hazard, and expense, I should gain the contradictory imputation of being, at the same time, the hireling of the one, and the tool of the other: and that Mr. Wilkes, the only private gainer in the struggle, should, of all men in the world, be the person to bring the charge against me. Mr. Wilkes, in perfect idleness and security, four times elected member for Middlesex, and twice alderman of London, a gainer of thirty thousand pounds, is the person to impute to me an interested design! to me, who have frequently risked the whole, and actually spent a great part of my little fortune in the contest, often exposed to a prison, and sometimes to death! an interested design! Sumo superbiam. I know there is not one even of his phalanx that believes it.
After the summer recess, the society was to meet again Nov. 27, 1770. 
On Monday, October 22, 1770 I received a note from Mr. Wilkes, to inform me that he would call the next day to talk with me on some business of consequence. I was at that moment going into the country for a week, the post-chaise was at the door, and my company waiting: I desired a gentleman who was in my room to answer the note, and to tell him I would visit him as soon as I returned. According to my promise, on Sunday, October
28, I went to Mr. Wilkes, at Fulham. Our conversation turned chiefly on three things: His brother's pretensions to the chamberlainship; his expectations from the London Tavern; and his intended proceedings at Westminster on the Wednesday following. It was my misfortune to be of a different opinion from Mr. Wilkes on all three: indeed we seldom did concur in any measure, except in those which tended to his private advantage; as far as I thought it just and honourable to pursue his private interest, I met with his hearty concurrence; for he found my endeavours effectual, and he reaped the instant benefit. In all public measures our opinions have been uniformly as different as our aims. However, when I look back on what is past, I find the voice of the people (which Mr. Wilkes calls the voice of God) in my favour: and, if the public are not to be condemned, Mr. Wilkes cannot have been very right, nor I very wrong: for, however new and extraordinary it may seem to those who are unacquainted with the particulars of what has passed, it is nevertheless most certain, that Mr. Wilkes has strenuously opposed almost every measure which the public has adopted. But, as I mean hereafter to explain the whole of his conduct in those matters, I shall confine myself at present to what relates to the Society at the London Tavern. Mr. Wilkes desired ready money. I thought it a shameful request: I repeated to him the situation of the society, which was in arrears; and showed him, that, in order to discharge his remaining debts, we must borrow from some of the members on the credit of the society. His debts being once discharged, I told him, I would venture to answer for it, that he would have a clear annuity of 600�.; that if it amounted to 1000�. I should be better pleased, but would not press the thing beyond 6oo�.; that this annuity, with what he had and what his relations could do for him, ought to content him; but, whether he was contented or not, that I should trouble myself on that score no further. That we had already dwelt too long and exhausted ourselves too much in his private affairs, and should deservedly meet with the scorn and derision of the public, if we did not proceed to matters of greater public importance. Mr. Wilkes still pressed for ready money, and said it would be doing him more kindness to give him the money, and trust for the remainder of his debts to the chapter of accidents. He urged to me his old argument, which he has often repeated to many people, that � 'those who do pay make amends for those who do not; and that tradesmen always charge accordingly.' I replied, that the same pretence would equally justify him for robbing them on the highway, or burning their houses down; because no doubt their gain in trade, if they are not undone, must supply all their losses. As I continued obstinate, Mr. Wilkes grew angry: he said, if he was to be treated so, it was plain
the society had only made a decoy-duck of his name, and that he was used only as an instrument. I grew warm in my turn, I reproached him for his unreasonableness, selfishness, and ingratitude; I asked him what merit he pretended to with the public, and what claim he had to their support, but as an instrument of public good; and I assured him I would take care he should not be able to cast that reproach on the society; for that as soon as we had completed the provision for him I had mentioned, I would make a motion to give him all the money that should remain over in in the banker's hand; and to advertise that, for the future, no more subscriptions would be received by the society, unless some great pub- lie occasion should arise, which exceeded the abilities of that society alone to support.
What passed between us concerning the chamberlainship and the Westminster instructions, did not tend to restore his good humour towards me. He found it in vain to use any further endeavours to bend me to his purposes; and, from that day forwards, has employed every means, by paragraphs and otherwise, to destroy the effect of any opposition I might make to his scandalous attempts.
On the 27th of November, the society met; and a committee of accounts was appointed for the 7th of December following. At the next meeting of the society, December 11, a report was made from the committee.
On the 22d of January, 1771,the society met again, according to their last adjournment. Great industry had been used by Mr. Wilkes-to pack a majority, many meetings had been held, and dinners given at the prime minister's (Mr. Reynolds) for the purpose. Sixteen members, who had never paid the least attention to any part of the transactions, and had scarcely ever attended before, came merely to vote as Mr. Wilkes should please to direct: on the other hand, many gentlemen, who disliked the attempts on the society, now stayed away, disgusted at altercation and the indecent behaviour of some of Mr. Wilkes's agents; it is not wonderful, for in all large companies it is found that public wishes are not so sharp a spur as private interest. The same conduct which is pursued by the minister in packing a majority in another assembly naturally produced the same measures at this meeting. Like the house of commons. they voted their king money without an account, and an approbation of his conduct without an inquiry. It was by a small majority of a meeting, which consisted of forty-seven, 
|t was vain to represent to them, that they were imposing upon the public: that the society, when they solicited their subscriptions in April, 177�, had published an account of what debts of Mr. Wilkes still remained due, in order to induce them to subscribe: that after this certain account given, and after three years search, they were now talking to the public, in vague and uncertain expressions, of 'All the outstanding debts bona fide due,' and of 'some old debts of John Wilkes, esq. That the restriction of bona fide was suppposing in Mr. Wilkes the extremity of ingratitude and mala fides: that on the 24th of July, 1771 eight gentlemen had lent to the society seven hundred pounds, on the following condition �that they were now violating that condition, and making it impossible to believe any account the society might hereafter give to the public; and that since that loan near five thousand pounds had been discharged for Mr. Wilkes: these and all other arguments were in vain; they did not want to examine accounts, or to consider what was past; they came to vote for Mr. Wilkes, and the propriety of the measures was left for him to reconcile.
Finding all arguments in vain, and knowing very well by what sort of a majority the questions had been carried, I was desirous to put to the test the extravagant zeal and prodigious personal disinterested friendship which had been expressed for Mr. Wilkes. I moved that the subscription might instantly begin, and called upon them, at this time of their excessive professions, when so many zealous members were present together, to show their sincerity by their subscriptions. My motion was by no means relished, the gentlemen felt the difference between voting away other men's money and giving their own. There was much struggle to avoid the question; but the ridicule was too strong even for them; they were ashamed, immediately after voting the subscription, to vote against its beginning. The question, therefore, was carried unanimously. The book was instantly opened and presented to the gentlemen; and, when the secretary, next morning, came to cast up the total of the subscriptions, he found it amounted to the exact sum of �0.0.0 
After this meeting, many of the most respectable members talked of quitting the society, which they thought much better than staying there to wrangle, or to be made a mere club for Mr. Wilkes to impose upon the public by general professions, and to receive subscriptions solely for the support of his extravagance. It would not have been at all difficult to have persuaded a large majority to attend for once, and re-establish the public principles on which the society first began; but once, or many times, would not have sufficed. Mr. Wilkes is too artful and industrious in mischief, and the tools he works with too stupid and obedient not to have made a perpetual attendance necessary. Such an attendance few men can, and still fewer will give, when they have no private purpose to answer; especially where they are to be liable to the ignorance and brutality of such men as Mr. Reynolds, whilst Mr. Wilkes is dexterous enough to avail himself of the former quality in his agents, to turn the latter upon his opponents. Besides, it is always much easier to produce confusion than to preserve order; and, if Mr. Wilkes could every now and then procure a majority to adopt and publish some imprudent measure, the society would be sure to lose their character, and with it their importance; and we knew, for he had declared long before, that he was determined to destroy it. Still we were willing to try every measure to
preserve the society, whose dissolution, as to every public purpose, we foresaw with infinite regret.
At the next meeting, therefore, of the society, on February 12, 1771, one of the members rose and desired to be indulged with some conversation, though he was not going to make a motion: he desired only to explain his own sentiments and understand theirs: he repeated his own public motives, and showed they were originally the declared motives of the society: much dispute, he said, had, however, been lately held, whether these were originally the avowed intentions of the society, or whether it had been instituted merely for the support and emolument of Mr. Wilkes, to the exclusion of all other public measures; he therefore, for his part, waved entirely that dispute: he desired only to know what were the sentiments the society would declare now, and whether they would determine to act for the future as a public society, giving support and effectual assistance to every thing which Mr. Horne, was importantly useful to the rights of the nation and mankind, or confine themselves singly to Mr. Wilkes? He said he did not mean to make a motion of this, or put it to the vote: if there were Jive, or even three members of that society present, who would acknowledge themselves to be confined merely to the raising of money for Mr. Wilkes, he would quit the society at once without troubling them with any reasoning on the subject. � Several other gentlemen declared the same sentiments. � This conversation was entirely unforeseen; Mr. Wilkes himself was not present; his leading partisans were without instructions on the subject; the professions were only in general of public motives; and general professions are safely made by the most interested men, who never mean to come to particulars. Much conversation however passed of a different tendency, yet no one member would acknowledge a private principle of action. The member who spoke first then rose again, and said, since he found they were all agreed in their general motives, he would now make a particular motion in consequence; and he moved � He represented to them that it was now near three years since Mr. Bingley was first sent to prison; that he had suffered almost as much imprisonment as Mr. Wilkes, and had hitherto received no reward for resisting attachment and interrogatories, which were much more dangerous and dreadful than general warrants; that besides, he was in a station where sentiment and public principle were not so much to be expected as in Mr. Wilkes's, and therefore required the greater encouragement. He said, he did not desire any gentleman present to subscribe to this; that he knew the money would be raised; the only question for them to consider was, whether the society should have the honour of the gift, or whether it should be given out of the society, by those gentlemen who had already determined on the measure and were desirous to contribute?
This motion seemed too reasonable to admit of debate, and yet it met with great opposition from Mr. Wilkes's friends. It was, however, carried by a majority; and near half the money was instantly subscribed.
At the next meeting of the society, February 26, 1771, Mr. Wilkes attended. He had collected his forces, and was shameless enough to cause them to come to the following resolution:
Before this resolution was passed, every possible method was tried for an accommodation: it was proposed that every person might be permitted in that society to subscribe for whatever good purpose he should adopt: it was shown plainly, that, by this vote, they would exclude from the society every one who wished to do public good, and who yet might not choose to subscribe to Mr. Wilkes, or, having given something, might not consent to subscribe any more. Mr. Wilkes would listen to no terms; he was now sure to accomplish his wishes, and saw, that from this day, the society would either exist no longer, or would exist for him only.
