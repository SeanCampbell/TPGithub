But a time will come, when we shall known, even as we are known. This expression to KNOW, even as we are KNOWN, implies a perfect Knowledge of that eternal Being, which is infinite in Knowledge, in Power, in Majesty, in Glory, &c.-And therefore a more exalted State of Happiness cannot be conceived, than that which a perfect Knowledge of GOD must afford!-A Happiness to be expected only in Heaven, when Human Nature shall have put on Incorruption and Immortality. But though we can neither attain, in this life, a perfect Knowledge of God, nor that perfect Happiness which results from it, yet it is our duty to improve and cultivate our limited Knowledge concerning the Divine Nature, as far as God has been pleased to reveal himself to us in the Scriptures; for SO FAR the Knowledge is undoubtedly necessary to MAN, even in this life, or otherwise, we may be assured, the Revelation would not have been made, in the Scriptures, �by Inspiration of God,� who cannot act in vain! Let us therefore earnestly desire to partake of that necessary Knowledge, and let us look into the evidences of it with the most awful reverence, and the most humble submission of our FAITH to the Word of GOD; lest through any improper conception of the Divine Nature, we should unhappily fall under a similar condemnation to that of Eliphaz, and his two friends, who visited Job.
When Moses desired to see the Glory of JEHOVAH (saying, �I beseech thee show me THY GLORY�) he was answered by the Almighty. We must therefore limit our ideas of those appearances under which God revealed himself to the Patriarchs, and to Moses;-for the Gospel expressly informs us, that �no Man hath seen God at any time� (but the Evangelist immediately adds with respect to the Messiah) That is, hath clearly declared or shown the Father, or, as Mr. Leigh has remarked upon the Word in his Critica Sacra-idest (says he) Nobis ad ejus veram cognitionem eruendam Dux et Auctor, suit, &c.
This is further explained by the declaration of our Lord himself. Not that any Man hath SEEN the eternal BEING (or JEHOVAH,) I mean the Divine Nature, in which the Son of Man (even while on Earth) was and is in the Bosom of the Father, (and in which now that he is ascended into Heaven) he is always with his Church ON EARTH, though he 
Compare this with the Context in the same Chapter. The Divine Person, whom �THE CITIES OF JUDAH� are here called upon to BEHOLD, was afterwards (agreeable to this prophecy) particularly pointed out by John the Baptist, to �the Cities of Judah,� and the Office of that faithful Harbinger, or Forerunner, in proclaiming the Advent as well as the Dignity of the Divine Person, that was �to be seen, or made manifest to Israel,� is as distinctly foretold in the 3d and 5th Verses of the same Chapter. Then beheld their GOD in the Person of the Son of God, and saw the Glory of Jehovah, that was promised to be revealed, without perceiving it, agreeable to another Prophecy of Isaiah yet all Flesh did not then SEE him �together!� Succeeding Generations, indeed, may be said to see, and also to perceive the Glory of Jehovah, that is, with the Eye of Faith in the scriptures: but the prophecy will, most certainly, by literally and universally fulfilled AT THE DAY OF JUDGMENT. Even those Men shall see, that now presume to deny the Divine Nature of our Redeemer, and refuse to worship him; For then �THE GLORY OF JEHOVAH� will be so revealed that �ALL FLESH SHALL SEE (it) TOGETHER,� even those Men shall see, that now presume to deny the Divine Nature of our Redeemer, and refuse to worship him. 
The Eternal WORD, though he was in the Beginning with GOD, and was GOD, yet under the Dispensation of the Gospel (that he might restore the lost Dignity of fallen Man) became the Angel, or MESSENGER of GOD; that is, of Jehovah Tsabaouth, the Lord of Hosts. For he was-�the Messenger of the Covenant,� foretold by the Prophet Malachi, and being also Lord of Hosts himself, he sent another Messenger before his Face to prepare his WAY.
Thus it appears, that the Messenger (whom our Lord himself declared to be John the Baptist) was to be sent to prepare the Way before JEHOVAH OF HOSTS, the same Divine Being who SPOKE by the Prophet. But our Lord himself, in referring to this Passage, varies a little from the Original, by making a Distinction of Persons between the Lord (or Jehovah of Hosts) who spoke, and the Divine Person before whom the Messenger was to prepare the Way- This Variation from the first to the second Person, from my to thy, and from me to thee, proves that Christ (for it cannot be applied to any other but Christ and Jehovah) was indeed the Person before whom the Messenger, John, was to prepare the Way; and the original Text (which undoubtedly is also a true Reading in this Place, as it perfectly corresponds with all the ancient Versions) proves at the same time, that the Way was to be prepared for Jehovah, who said, Behold, I will send MY Messenger, and he shall prepare the Way before ME; and consequently it appears, by comparing both Texts, that CHRIST is included in the Eternal Being JEHOVAH The Socinians endeavor to evade this Testimony of the Scripture concerning the Divine Nature of the Messiah, by supposing that he is called Jehovah only in a relative Sense, as being the Prophet, or Ambassador of JEHOVAH, the Representative being named for the Principal. In like manner, for Instance (say they) as he that despiseth Christ�s Messengers, is said to despise Christ himself; and he that despiseth him, despiseth also him that sent him. And he that lied to the Apostles, lied to God.
In these and such like Passages, indeed, the relative Sense is manifest; and it may also, in a certain degree, be admitted in the Construction of the Text in question, but yet not so as to favour the Socinian Argument in the least respect whatsoever. 
The Prophecy, for instance, concerning the Messenger therein mentioned (of whom JEHOVAH said,-�he shall prepare the Way before ME�) was fulfilled in the Person of John the Baptist, ad our Lord himself declared; and therefore, according to the Socinian Method of Argument, it might indeed be said of those worldly Men, who despised that extraordinary Messenger of Jehovah, and neglected the Doctrine of Repentance, which he enforced; that they, in so doing, despised the Lord Jehovah, by whom this Messenger was sent; and, on the other hand, those Jews, who readily received John�s Doctrine of Repentance, and attended diligently to his Instruction, may, in the like relative Sense, be said to honour Jehovah, by paying due Respect to his Messenger. But a mere relative Honour, such as might lawfully be given to the Messenger of Jehovah, will bear no Comparison with the Honour that is due to Jehovah himself; -the latter must be supreme Honour and Worship, whereas the former amounts only to Respect, Attention, and good Offices, for whatever is more than these must lead to Idolatry; so that the Comparison can be carried no farther.
A Messenger of Jehovah cannot, therefore, merely as such, be allowed the Name of JEHOVAH, because this would entitle him also to the Honour that is due to JEHOVAH alone; so that when Jehovah said, �MY Messenger� - �he shall prepare the Way BEFORE ME,� he must mean (if Language has any Use) that the Messenger was to prepare the Way for the Advent of Jehovah himself, who could not be said to come in the Person of any Messenger or Ambassador whatsoever, except in one of the Divine Persons that are manifestly included in the same Eternal BEING, and consequently are entitled to the Honour and Worship, as well as to the Name, of JEHOVAH! This glorious Title JEHOVAH is no where in Scripture attributed to any Person whatever, that is not thus included in the Unity of the Godhead, neither can it be without Blasphemy (so that the Socinian Argument must fall to the Ground) because it is the distinguishing Title of the Supreme Divine Nature! Or it should rather be rendered, as we find it in the old English Versions-Thou, whose Name is JEHOVAH, art ONLY (or alone) the most High, &c.
The Division of the Sentence is agreeable to all the ancient Versions, except the Syriac; but, in either way of translating, the Name of JEHOVAH is manifestly given as the distinguishing Title of the supreme GOD; and cannot therefore be attributed to any Person whatever, that is not truly God, because the said Distinction would be destroyed, if the Name was ever used merely in that relative Sense for which the Socinians contend: Proper Names, indeed were frequently formed or compounded with that Holy Name, by having it prefixed, or postfixed, to some other Word, apparently with an Intention to distinguish the Servants of JEHOVAH; but the peculiar and incommunicable Name itself has never been mentioned by any of the Sacred Writers in such a manner, as to refer us either in direct Terms, or by necessary Implication, to any other Persons whatsoever, besides those of the Holy Trinity; and on the other hand, with respect to Christ, it is not only the Name of JEHOVAH that is referred to him by the necessary Interpretation of several incontestable Passages of Scripture; but also the Power, the Honour, and the Glory of Jehovah: so that the Socinian Evasion before mentioned is as vain as it is wicked, whenever it is applied to those Passages of Scripture wherein the Name of Jehovah is attributed to that Divine Person.
JEHOVAH is the proper and essential Name of ALMIGHTY GOD, because it, in some degree, expressed his Eternal Being or Existence, being a compound Word, including different Tenses or Times of the Hebrew Verb TO BE, or rather (as it is the Preterperfect Tense,) signifying HE WAS; from whence is formed, the Participle as well as Present Tense, signifying, according to Buxtorf�s Concordance (though, in his Lexicon, he renders it also FUIT) �ens, es, est;� being thou art, he is; to which the prefixed the true characteristic Letter of the Future Tense (shall or will be), is also added to form the Word JEHOVAH: so that this mysterious and awful Name seems to express ALL TIME, or ETERNITY; as if, for instance, a Word was to be compounded of three different Tenses of the Latin Word esse; to be, viz. est, fuit, erit (he is,-he was,-he shall be) yet so as to include the Sense of all three, and consequently to denominate in one single Word an Eternal BEING, that ever did, and ever will, EXIST. �And such seems to be the Interpretation of the glorious Name JEHOVAH, according to the Opinion of the most learned in the Hebrew Tongue, viz. �ENS, EXISTENS AB ETERNO ET IN ETERNUM,� A BEING existing from all Eternity and for ever. This is the Sense which the learned Buxtorf has quoted in his Hebrew Lexicon from the famous Jewish Rabbin Aben Ezra, and he cites also the Authority of several others of the most eminent Jews much to the same Purpose. But as the Words of Holy Scripture are best interpreted by Holy Scripture, he refers us at the same time to a Text in the Revelations, wherein the Apostle John addresses the Seven Churches of Asia in the NAME OF GOD, which is there clearly expressed in the same Sense that the Jews (as I have before remarked) have attributed to the Hebrew Name JEHOVAH, and seems therefore to be the true Interpretation of it. In like manner the four Beasts, or rather living Animals (which in the Revelations represent the Hosts or Armies of Israel, by the Figures of those Animals which were borne on the Standards of the four principal Tribes in their Encampments round the Tabernacle)
This Eternal BEING, which has been pleased to reveal himself to us in such clear and comprehensive terms, is the same Almighty JEHOVAH that is mentioned in Genesis in the highest terms of Power and Glory. And therefore, as the LORD, or JEHOVAH, mentioned in these several texts, is undoubtedly THE SUPREME GOD, we are naturally led to attribute the same Divine Excellence, and supreme Dignity, to the glorious name JEHOVAH, wherever it occurs in other parts of Scripture, because there is but ONE JEHOVAH! Thus the Unity of God is proved to be an indispensable article of our Faith! And yet we are equally bound to acknowledge, that Three Divine Persons are comprehended in that One, Almighty and Eternal BEING, or JEHOVAH!-because this glorious name is clearly applied, in the Holy Scriptures (even in those of the Old Testament) to as many distinct Persons; who are, therefore, to be esteemed equal, or ONE, with the supreme God, as �Jehovah our God (is) ONE JEHOVAH!�
For though we are bound to acknowledge a manifest subordination with respect to the merciful and gracious OFFICES of Redemption and Sanctification, whereby Two of the Divine Persons are particularly distinguished in Scripture, yet we are obliged, at the same time, to believe, that the several Divine Persons are of One and the same Eternal and Almighty EXISTENCE with respect to that incomprehensible BEING, or Divine Nature, wherein their Unity consists; because the contrary Doctrines of those Men, who deny that OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, and THE HOLY GHOST partake of the same Divine Nature with THE FATHER, do manifestly and necessarily include the supposition of a superior and inferior order of DIVINE EXISTENCE (for that all the Three Persons have Divine Existence and Divine Attributes cannot be denied, without setting aside the whole tenor of the Holy Scriptures) which EXISTENCE could not, without absurdity, be called one and the same, but must necessarily be esteemed several or separate and different, if the least degree of Inequality with respect to the Divine Nature be admitted; and therefore such Doctrines are totally inconsistent with our indispensable Belief in the Unity of God, whatsoever those mistaken people, who call themselves Unitarians, may think. 
But a due regard to these two necessary distinctions, viz. the Equality and Unity (as there is but ONE GOD) of the THREE Persons with respect to their Divine Nature, and the revealed subordination of TWO of them with respect to the merciful and gracious OFFICES of Redemption and Sanctification, whereby they are personally distinguished and made known to us in Scripture;-a due regard to these two necessary distinctions (I say) and to the proper application of the several texts by which both are respectively proved, will clearly demonstrate (at least to all Men who sincerely ask and seek the knowledge of truth, as Christ has commanded) that the Doctrine of the Trinity, as received by THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND, is strictly consistent with the indispensable doctrine of Scripture mentioned concerning the Unity of God.
That there are Three distinct Persons in that One ETERNAL BEING, or JEHOVAH, is clearly revealed in Scripture; for each Person is occasionally mentioned under that distinguishing and peculiar Name of the Supreme God.
And first, with respect to the first Divine Person in the Holy Trinity.-In the 42d chapter of Isaiah, the Divine Person, whom the prophet represents in the 6th verse, as speaking in the Name of Jehovah, is clearly distinguished from the MESSIAH and HOLY SPIRIT; and though it may seem a needless work to produce any proofs that the Almighty Father, �THE GOD and FATHER of our Lord JESUS CHRIST,� is truly JEHOVAH (which no Man will deny.) yet I propose to recite some parts of this chapter, in order to prove the clear distinction of Persons and their Offices, as revealed even in the Old Testament. These words of JEHOVAH are manifestly addressed to the MESSIAH, as a distinct Person in his mediatorial Office of Redeemer; and the Divine Person, who thus addressed the Messiah, is manifestly the same that speaks in the first verse of the same chapter, and mentions both THE MESSIAH and the HOLY SPIRIT in that one sentence as distinct PERSONS FROM HIMSELF, and under different and distinct characters or offices of the Christian Dispensation, suitable to the nature of that extraordinary prophecy concerning the future Redemption of Mankind! Thus we find the Office of THE MESSIAH particularly described in this chapter, as well as the descent of THE HOLY SPIRIT upon HIM: and this is expressly foretold by the Lord JEHOVAH, who speaks of himself distinctly from the other two; so that the distinction of Persons is hereby clearly manifested. 
Secondly, The glorious Name of the supreme God JEHOVAH, is plainly attributed, in the 40th chapter of Isaiah, to the Second Person, the Divine Messiah, in his Pastoral Office, as �Shepherd of Israel.�
The Peculiar Harbinger or Forerunner of the Messiah is described and foretold in the third verse, as the Forerunner also of JEHOVAH.
And John the Baptist, in whom alone that prophecy could be fulfilled (as I have shown more particularly in my Tract on Prophecy) declared the identity of the Divine Person whom he preceded in the world, and whose WAY he was SENT TO PREPARE. �And afterwards, when the Priests and Levites (those that were sent from Jerusalem to ask him, �Who art thou�) questioned him. And �the next day� he bore full and express testimony to the identity of the Divine Person that came after him, whose WAY WE PREPARED.
Thus John declared himself to be the peculiar Harbinger (as I have said) of the SON OF GOD; so that the name of JEHOVAH (whose WAY, in the prophecy, he is expressly said to prepare) must necessarily be attributed to the Messiah, to whom afterwards this long expected preceding Messenger did personally apply the prophecy.
And the Divine Person, for whom THE WAY was to be thus prepared, is so distinctly described by his Advent, and Pastoral Office, in the 9th, 10th, and 11th verses of this chapter, that the proper application of the glorious titles therein mentioned, cannot be mistaken, at least by those who sincerely seek after truth! To the fulfilling of which in Christ the Apostle Paul (as I have already shown) bears ample testimony. But to return to the Prophet. It is surely the REWARD and WORK of the MESSIAH in his Pastoral Office, that are here so distinctly foretold; and therefore the Adjective HIS, and the Personal Pronoun HIM (both expressed by in the Original, and so often repeated in these verses) as also the Personal Pronouns HIM and HE must necessarily be referred, by the plainest rules of grammar, to the Personal Nouns (THE LORD GOD, or ADONI JEHOVAH) which immediately precede them, and by which the Holy Spirit has marked the supreme or equal Divinity of the Messiah with the Father, and that he is really JEHOVAH and GOD beyond all possibility of contradiction!
Before the Incarnation of the Divine Logos, or WORD OF GOD (that is, before he �was MADE FLESH, and dwelt among us� God revealed himself to the children of Israel, not only by the name of (JEHOVAH, signifying Eternal Existence, by including the characteristically letters of the Present, Preterite, and Future Tenses, as I have already shown) but also by the name of A-hi-ah, which is the same verb of Being or Existence, with the sign only of the Future Tense, signifying, I WILL BE: and when the Son of God was personally present on earth, in our HUMAN NATURE, as a Descendant of Abraham he asserted his pre-existent state, by giving himself a similar title of Eternal Existence, though in a different Tense; for he used the Present Tense alone, without any characteristical Letter of the Future, I AM, instead of, I WILL BE (as the promises respecting his own Person were accomplished by his PRESENCE, which, as he himself also promised, will continue to the end of the world.) �Before Abraham was,� (said our Lord) �I AM.� This expression (if the occasion of its being made be duly considered) cannot be made to accord properly with its context in any other sense than as a reference to Christ�s Eternal Existence; and, as such, it manifestly corresponds with the meaning of the glorious Name JEHOVAH. 
The purpose of our Lord�s argument was certainly, to declare his pre-existent State of Glory, in answer to the Jews. So that his immediate answer-�Before Abraham WAS, I AM,� must necessarily be understood in the sense which I have mentioned.
He had, a little time before, told the Jews, who disputed with him, �I proceeded forth� (said he) �and came from God.� The expression in the original Greek has a much deeper meaning; it is not merely �from God,� as in the common English translation; but out of God, -�OUT OF GOD, I PROCEEDED FORTH,� &c. which is much more expressive of that procession, which is commonly called the Eternal Generation of the SON,-of that Divine Person. Has not these Jewish unbelievers been blinded by their own wickedness, and worldly desires, they would have understood by the Prophets, that their Messiah, though he was to be a Descendant of Abraham, according to the promises, was yet to be one who had ETERNAL EXISTENCE, and consequently must be entitled to the incommunicable name of Eternal Existence, JEHOVAH; for he, �whose goings forth (have been) from of old, from everlasting,� was the same of whom the Prophet Micah saith, that he should come out of BETHLEHEM EPHRATAH, �to be Ruler in Israel,� viz. that Ruler of whom the same Prophet foretold, �that they should smite the JUDGE OF ISRAEL with a rod upon the cheek.� Compare the first and second verses of this chapter. And in the fourth verse-the name of Jehovah, is manifestly attributed to the same Divine Person. Compare this also with the Prophecy of Jeremiah concerning THE BRANCH from the stock of JESSE.
