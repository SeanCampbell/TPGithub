EARL TEMPLE TO SIR ARMINE WODEHOUSE
September 5, 1765
Sir, � At my return late last night from an expedition into Worcestershire, I found your letter of the 26th of August, by which you wish to know whether Mr. Pitt and I approve of the present arrangement of Government; to which I can with great truth and openness answer, first, for myself, that I do not; next for Mr. Pitt, that he neither had, nor would have, any the least share in the formation of it, as it now stands; he is retired into Somersetshire, and has not, I dare say, any the smallest communication with them. If they pursue the measures which we stipulated for on behalf of the public, no doubt, so far, they will be entitled to our support and approbation; but, as I look upon the system to be weak and insufficient, I cannot say I entertain any hopes from it in favour of my country.
I found myself under the unfortunate necessity of declining all the gracious offers of His Majesty under the circumstances which then existed, but I should be most happy, if I could see such a Government formed as could reasonably engage public confidence at home and abroad: 'till that is happily accomplished, I fear we shall continue in a weak and divided state, inviting insults, unable to repel them.
I have now fully obeyed your commands, and have at all times a pleasure in assuring you that, whether we act together politically or not, I am always much, Sir, your obedient, humble servant, Temple.
EARL TEMPLE TO (MR. MACKINTOSH)
October 13, 1765.
My dear Sir, � I have perused the Minutes1 you sent me, which carry with them every mark of being, as far as they go, strictly genuine. Nothing can be more amiable than the whole tenor of the conversation on one part, or more friendly towards me on the other, than the various explanations given both of my feelings and conduct in almost all the parts which were touched. An obligation I can never forget.
The delivery of the Paper, as the result of what had passed here, is very delicate, and you know I chose to say as little as possible; it contains, however, the result of my real feelings, and is unexceptionably drawn up; nay, so judiciously is it worded, that I would have wished to have had an opportunity of saying myself the same things to both if called upon, with the variation only of desiring to hear the King's ideas rather than presume to think of offering any of my own.
My sense of the difficulties which late transactions have superadded to what was but too difficult before, no man who has conversed with me can be a stranger to. Mr. Pitt is in my notions indispensable, and you know I think too much regard cannot be shewn him. The determinations of his mind since he went into Somersetshire I know not, but whenever he is called upon as before, I take it for granted he will give them with the same duty and zeal. I read the latter part of your letter and smile, � I think we even laughed out at Stowe, � happy here and everywhere else in assuring you that I am sincerely, &c., &c.
Many kind compliments to Mr. I avoid writing more than is absolutely necessary. Infinite secresy is
indispensable.
EARL TEMPLE TO MR. GRENVILLE
July 18, 1766.
My dear Brother, � I am this instant returned from London, which I left last night a little after nine. You will easily foresee that I have declined. The intended basis of the new, virtuous, and patriotic Administration is to be the Rump of the last, strengthened by the particular friends of Mr. Pitt, the whole consisting of all the most choice spirits who did in the last Session most eminently distinguish themselves in the sacrifice of the rights and honour of the whole Legislature and Kingdom of Great Britain. At the head of this I might have stood a capital cypher, surrounded with cyphers of quite a different complexion, the whole under the guidance of that great Luminary, the great Commoner, with the Privy Seal in his hand.
It was thought extraordinary that I should dream of a Cabinet place for Lord Lyttelton, but as an act of special grace to me, he might have been indulged with a place, and called to the Cabinet, as I suppose of the hanging Committee.
Lord Gower, Secretary of State, could not be thought of.
I had my last audience of the King yesterday at three o'clock. I stayed with him an hour: very gracious, and I believe not a little delighted with my declining. Illuminations, City Address, &c, all preparing: whether any damp will be cast upon them, I know not.
I have not stated you as a Candidate for anything, but most expressly declined it, as a thing of more dignity or you, and a proof of my infinite moderation compared with all the insolence in return.
I suppose I shall be much abused, as the public is much disappointed, but I am more sinned against than sinning. Thus ends this political farce of my journey to town, as it was always intended, and I am now going to bed to get a little sleep, and to rise very happy.
Nugent will not be Vice-Treasurer. I just learn, my cook, drunk from the Assizes, has tumbled off his horse I have one coming from London, but if he does not recover, I believe I must send a file of musqueteers for yours.
EARL TEMPLE TO EARL GOWER
July 19, 1766. My Lord, � At my return from the Queen's house on Thursday I did myself the honour of calling upon your Lordship to ask your pardon for the liberty I had taken, without your knowledge or approbation, to state your Lordship as a person who I wished to see one of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State. The service which I was sure your Lordship would do to your King and country, led me to that nomination, and the conviction of it was so strong upon my mind that I hope I shall be forgiven by your Lordship.
This idea did not meet with Mr. Pitt's approbation. Other circumstances concurred to make it impossible for me to engage in the King's service in the high station to which His Majesty has been graciously pleased again to call me. The plan of an administration, formed entirely of those who had in the course of the last sessions so disgracefully sacrificed the honour and interests of the King and kingdom, could not meet with my approbation; and if a lead of superiority was claimed, it was rejected, on my part, with an assertion of my pretensions to an equality.
I will apprize your Lordship, and my other friends, of more particulars when I have the honour of seeing you and them. In the meantime, be so good to communicate this letter to the Duke of Bedford. 
Lady Temple and I join in begging the favour of your Lordship to assure the whole House of Woburn of our best respects; and I have only to add for myself, that if you forgive me you will make happy, my Lord, your Lordship's, &c, &c. Temple.
I returned to this place in the night of Thursday, as was resolved no family considerations should prevent the formation of a Ministry upon a plan of general union. I entirely waived any pretensions for my brother, and in so doing I thought I gave a high proof of my moderation and real desire to facilitate the success of this new negotiation. My brother, who called here with Nugent last night, and left us this morning, did not intend to write to the Duke of Bedford, as he knew I was so soon to have the honour of seeing his Grace.
EARL TEMPLE TO
July 20, 1766
My dear Lord, � I received the honour of your Lordship's most obliging letter last night.
I left London on Thursday night after two conferences with His Majesty, and one with Mr. Pitt; I could not lend myself to the ideas of the latter, whose plan of the future Ministry consisted entirely of those who, in my opinion, sacrificed in the last Sessions most ignominiously the honour and interests of the King and kingdom, the consequence of which would have been the making me a cypher, at the head of the first department in administration. For the sake of public and general union I was willing to accommodate myself to Mr. Pitt's negative to my brother Grenville being a part of the intended Ministry, and I never proposed it. I felt it was impossible to give a higher mark of my desire of universal conciliation; after which I claimed an equality, and have no idea of yielding to him in a bystanding situation, or indeed in any other, a superiority which I think it would be unbecoming in me to give. Thus am I deprived of the means of accomplishing what it is pretended I was called to, having only to add that both in and out of government, I am, my dear Lord, much your obedient humble servant, Temple.
I stated Lord Lyttelton for a Cabinet Council office, which was not agreed to, nor was my idea of making Lord Gower a Secretary of State consented to, Mr. Pitt having objections to both. The nomination of Chancellor of the Exchequer, and of my whole Board, was left to me.
EARL TEMPLE TO MR. GRENVILLE
August 21,1766, 
My dear Brother, � I learn that things go very lamely on at St. James's, that the great and little Earl are already upon ill terms, the great Earl demanding from the little one the immediate execution of certain stipulations, which diminutive wishes to postpone. He affects to be very indifferent upon the subject of the city of London, says he has held the cap to them long enough, that for the future he shall devote himself to the King's service entirely, and execute that so long as His Majesty shall approve of his counsels and measures; if not, he shall withdraw from all, and retire to Burton Pynsent.
Q. How Lord Gower's judgment will direct him; the Duke of Bedford once refused to come into office himself, put Lord G. in, and in a little time accepted likewise himself.
I know authentically that my conduct in refusing is not applauded by that quarter, and that the offer has been invited, as far as certain expressions of longings for office do invite, and I believe much further too; however, we shall now see, and the event is very indifferent to me. The testimony of adopting my plan, after refusing to me the execution of it, is, I think, advantageous to me; and as to the rest, I see nothing within the possibility of things which can give me real satisfaction on behalf of the public. Yours affectionately,Temple.

EARL TEMPLE TO MR. HUMPHREY COTES
August 24, J 766
I am very miserable, my dear Cotes, at what I this moment read in the papers with your name affixed to it.
I am sensible that you have been hurried into this step by an honest indignation and warm zeal for my honour, but were I to see you, I am sure I could convince you of the numberless mischiefs attending it. The Enquiry itself which you allude to contains many mistakes, and particularly on the subject of pensions; it was a lucrative office and not a pension that was proposed for Lord Lyttelton, with the Cabinet Council annexed: and as to the assertion which angers you, forgive me if I hold it not worthy of notice; I scorn to think it possible, any man who knows me can be misled by such an invention, which I am certain Lord Chatham would not countenance a moment. There now remains only for me to beg of you, on every account, not to proceed further in anything of this sort; all your friends and mine will join, I dare say, in the same request. Let me also add, that I am with much concern, though very sincerely, your faithful and obedient Temple.
EARL TEMPLE TO MR. GRENVILLE
November 20, 1766
I congratulate you most warmly, my dear brother, on your glorious triumph, not only over the wild alderman, but in him over the whole crew of new converts to tyranny and despotism.
Your victory is so complete, that I think it impossible the enemy can rally; their own proposition of indemnity to those who have acted under the Royal Authority admits the illegality, and requires that the indemnity should be extended as you propose. I am impatient to hear the further progress of so wonderful an outset as we were all witnesses to at the first meeting, distinguished for ever by neglect, ignorance, and high prerogative doctrines.
But of this, no more at present; if there is likely to be any debate in your House on the second reading, that is, should the Ministry persist in refusing to be indemnified, I will fly up time enough to be present, and in all events will not be absent when it is brought up to us, for I shall delight to be present at least at the quibbling retractation of principles odious and diabolical, which these ears have already heard, with an indignation equal to the prostitution. You know if you send any answer to this to my house on Friday night, it may be with me on Saturday night. Judge how impatient I must be. Sure Lord Suffolk and Lord Buckingham should be apprized in time. I have had another wonderful epistle from George.
As you say nothing of Mrs. G., we take no news to be good. Adieu! I am, &c, &c. Temple.
EARL TEMPLE TO MR. RIGBY
July 18, 1707
Lord Temple returns thanks to Mr. Rigby for all the obliging trouble he has taken, and sends back the Duke of Bedford's servant, without forwarding the papers by him to Wotton, as Lord Temple intends going over there himself this evening, and concerting with Mr. Grenville what may be the next proper step for them to take.
EARL TEMPLE TO MR. RIGBY
July 19, 1767
Lord Temple eagerly embraces the very first opportunity of assuring Mr. Rigby, and through him the Duke of Bedford, that there was not meant to be expressed, in the joint note of Mr. Grenville and Lord Temple, the smallest idea that there had not been a full communication to them on the part of his Grace of every circumstance of the present transaction.
On the contrary, many kind thanks are returned, and Lord Temple, being perfectly satisfied with what has hitherto passed, makes no doubt but the same sense and spirit will continue the same conduct to the end, or to good effect one way or other. As his Grace means to take the trouble of apprizing the Brothers of what passes between Lord Rockingham and the King, Lord Temple, to save trouble, apprizes Mr. Rigby that he dines at Wotton next Wednesday, and shall continue there two or three days.
EARL TEMPLE TO MR. GRENVILLE
October 23, 1767
My dear Brother, � You perfectly understand Beardmore's business; expressions of a total devotion to you and me on the part of Mr. M., who is, it seems, a Bucks gentleman, and a desire of our good offices at Aylesbury. The only question is, whether the Duke of B. and Lord G. will forgive him, which is much wished on his part.
As to London, I do not think of visiting it at all 'till after New Year's day, unless pressingly summoned to it
by the Bedfordians upon a plan of very determined opposition! If the kingdom choose to continue asleep in the hands of children and worse, I am tired of attempting to wake them from their delightful dreams, till they awake themselves with a vengeance. News I hear of none. I am much obliged to Lord and Lady Aylesford for their kind intentions through the vale of sin and death; when they are safely landed here, the rest of their journey will be very good. Respects and kind compliments to all, above and below Wottonian ground. Your most affectionate, T.
