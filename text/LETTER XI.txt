TO THE LEGISLATURE.
LETTER Xl
January 17, 1775
THROUGH the means of the persevering virtue of our American brethren, the heavy shades of parliamentary oppression being just in motion to retire, and the dawn of a constitutional revolution now beginning to gild the political horizon, the heart of every anxious lover of his country) and of every friend to the rights of mankind, must be greatly cheered thereat, as they will naturally flatter themselves with hopes, that the approaching day of deliberation shall bring forth healing councils and measures, sound and solid wisdom, genuine and complete justice, which could not fail to secure the lasting prosperity of Great-Britain and her affectionate offspring. It is with the molt lively sympathy in these hopes, and with the deepest gratitude to Providence for these auspicious appearances, that I advance, once more, to exhort ye to
pay due attention to the magnitude and importance of the business ye are about to enter upon ; and that ye will suffer no motives whatever to influence your sentiments or your actions, except those alone which shall arise from mature deliberation upon, and a rigid observance of your duty to your country. Unless these considerations shall have a an entire ascendency in your minds, in vain will ye attempt to act the part of wise politicians; in vain will ye
pretend to insure to these kingdoms any substantial and permanent advantages; as recent experience in American politics may amply serve to verify. And it is also because there still appears to remain on the minds of Britons a strong tincture of prejudice against a fall and compleat enjoyment of liberty by their American brethren, that take upon me once again to call up your attention to the fatal system of oppression that hath so long been the reproach of the British parliament, the false estimates that have been made of American knowledge and public spirit, together with the erroneous maxims of government that have, through a strange infatuation, been thereupon adopted, and I fear are even now relied on by some and that I also once again presume to recommend a parliamentary declaration of the independency of the American colonies, and then, that there be formed, by means of a general league, such an alliance between us as alone, in my opinion, can be effectually and durably beneficial to both countries: the nature, the practicability, the expediency and happy fruits of which league were pointed out in my letter of
the 14th of April, 1774. Although my sentiments were delivered somewhat unsystematically, and only occasionally, as ill health and other avocations afforded me leisure; and notwithstanding my arguments were accommodated to the limitations of a news-paper communication, I nevertheless produced, as I apprehend, sufficient reasons in support of the proposal I offered to your consideration. Many more of great weight and intrinsic excellence, will suggest themselves to every sensible man, who is possessed of knowledge enough to constitute him a judge of this question, provided his mind be prone to candour, and his heart to rectitude. It is true that at present I stand almost alone on this ground, and that men of the first abilities, and of the highest senatorial reputation, at the same time that they have uniformly condemned and vigorously opposed the measures of administration, have still invariably declared themselves the advocates, nay even the champions, of parliamentary sovereignty. But, so far as I have been able to learn, and I have not been negligent to gain information, they have contented themselves with declaring
without supporting their opinion. No one of them has, that I can recollect, justified it by argument; or by bringing it to the only touchstone of all pretensions to sovereignty, by shewing that it is rightly calculated to obtain,
for the people governed, the effectual security and continuance of their liberty and property: nor hath any one, that I know of, refuted my arguments for the proposed independency, or those of dean Tucker, which I have referred
to. I hope no one will be rash enough to say, that national morality and justice are not regarded by the Sovereign Judge of all nations, or that that state which seeks to aggrandize itself, at the expence of another, by craft and subtlety, by imposition and chicanery, or by any other wicked means, either deserves, or is likely to experience, any long continuance of God's favour and protection. Hath not the warning-voice of all history, from the first memorials of nations, uniformity inculcated this lesson by dreadful examples in every instance without exception, and shewn us that it is in the very laws of nature, in the
necessary constitution of things, that national integrity must in the end produce national happiness, and national turpitude, as certainly be followed by national misery? - Had we indeed no historical testimony in proof of this
doctrine, yet its truth is clearly deducible by reasoning; since there is this evident distinction to be made between the situation of nations and of individuals, men will continue to exist after death, but nations have no hereafter, and therefore God's just and wife providence seems to have
appointed them their rewards and punishments in this world. But to return, some there are who have indeed affected to treat the Idea of making the colonies independent, as too visionary and chimerical to be adopted by men practised in state affairs. - It should seem, however, from recent experience, that men practised in state affairs are not exempt, any more than those who reason on them from adopting visionary projects. But novelty doth by no means necessarily imply either fallacy or impracticability, as hath been
well exemplified in these latter ages, which have beheld various political phenomena altogether unknown before in the course of human affairs, and which were the natural effects of doctrines, whose chimerical appearance, while novel, were quite as alarming to the timid as this can be. Our union with Scotland, when first proposed, struck the majority in each division of the island with as great a panic fear of danger and ruin, as our disunion from America (if that can be called a disunion of countries on different sides of the globe that is only meant to ascertain their true relation to each other) can possibly produce in the minds of any. The crude and dreaded idea took a
full century to ripen, before it could be relished by the people. Our general experience, since the revival of earning, ought to reconcile us to the making of innovations upon all suspicious systems, wherever the suggesting principles appear, upon close examination, to be sound, just, and uncontrovertible; and it need scarcely be remarked, that it hath been by such means alone that we
have hitherto so successfully combated ignorance, superstition, tyranny and persecution, together with innumerable errors, in the whole circle of science, and that we must keep in the same path if we propose to make any farther
progress. But how, indeed, can any improvements be made, except by adopting and acting upon new ideas, as they arise on a contemplation of new circumstances and contingencies? Provided the British legislature had not first
inconsiderately, and afterwards perversely, trespassed on the lights of the colonies, slighted their just complaints, despised their remonstrances, and, by a long and wanton, series of injuries, insults, and oppressions, rouzed their
friends, and obliged them to take the trouble of thinking, it is probable that the idea of their having a right to independency might have lain dormant, in the unexplored repositories of truth, for ages to come. lf therefore they have prematurely brought on new contingencies, they must not be offended with, nor inattentive to, new ideas. Having myself the highest respect for the shining talents, the knowledge and principles of some great men from whom I differ, both with regard to the right, and to the expediency also, of asserting our parliamentary sovereignty over the North-American states, I wish most earnestly they may enter on a full discussion of those questions, either before the public, or in parliament; since I promise myself, they will ingenuously follow whithersoever truth and ï¿½justice shall lead them; either to their own conviction, or to mine; who am prepared to abandon my own opinion, the moment I can discover it to be no longer tenable without disingenuousness or prevarication: but I am principally moved to this wish, through a strong per-
suasion that the .suture prosperity of this, and the numerous nations of North America, (consequently the happiness of millions of our fellow creatures) may in a great measure depend on the opinions, upon the two points in question,
of a very few leading men, who, at this crisis, have voices in the British parliament. My voice, had I the honour of a seat, should most assuredly be heard to move for the independency of America.
   It is well known, and severely felt by us at this day, that the revolution, to which we owe our salvation from crown prerogative, from popery and despotism, glorious and providential as it was, had still its imperfections; and
that these remain to be reformed, or they will one day inevitably overwhelm the liberties, extinguish the last spark of virtue, and put a fatal period to the felicities of Britain. If ill consequences of such extent, could flow from beginnings so minute, as to be overlooked on that day of reformation, when national reflection and wisdom were displayed in so uncommon a degree; ought we not to be on our guard, while in the act of settling the constitution of
the American states upon a durable basis; and fixing a standard, a Magna Charta, to which the people of those states may at all times appeal, in defence of their rights and liberties; that we look not only to the securing of the
corner-stones and main buttresses, but take care also to cement the o:her, though inferior yet necessary, parts so closely together, as to prevent their being again shaken by the abuse of power ; or sapped by the insinuations of corruption, that grand specific for the dissolution of those fortresses of freedom, which mock all other attacks.  And allow me to remind ye, that at the period of the revolution, the dreadful state of the kingdom, when the government was dissolved, and all men impatient of a settlement for fear of an anarchy; when contending princes were striving for the throne, and all the powerful states of Europe ready to take their advantages, such a conjuncture
afforded excuses for much greater oversights than at this time, when we have leisure to keep our usual holidays, and are so much at our ease as to require diversions and all sorts of pleasurable amusements to fill up the vacuities of life, allowances can be made for. That man therefore who, on this solemn occasion, shall not pay the most sacred regard to the rights and liberties of his American brethren and their posterity, be his posessions, and even his actions, in other respects what they may, must be a very sorry pretender to patriotism. The true patriot will be as strenuous an opposer of national and parliamentary, as of regal tyranny: he will not attempt to remove the mote from the ministerial eye, before he have first plucked out the beam from his own. Consider, then, what in fact we are doing, and whither the unavoidable consequences will lead us, when we assert our parliamentary sovereignty.
If it cannot open to us the purses of the Americans, at the discretion of the British commons, ï¿½ which heaven of its mercy to ourselves forbid! ï¿½ what end is it to answer?
