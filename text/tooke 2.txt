TO THE RIGHT HON. GEORGE ONSLOW, ESQ.
Ash Court, 11th July, 1769.
'SIR,
I HAVE heard from very good authority that one of the lords of the treasury has lately gained a thousand pounds in a very common and usual manner, which is yet likely to be attended with a very uncommon and unusual consequence. Mr. - applied to the right hon. Mr. - , for his interest for a certain lucrative post in America. The gentleman was informed that a thousand pounds placed in the hands of Mrs. - would insure him the place. Mr. - not having the money, prevailed on col. - to join with him in a bond for that sum to the lady to whom he was directed. So far, sir, all is in the common track: what follows is the wonderful part of the transaction. This lord of the treasury kept his word, and the gentleman was appointed to the office he had paid for! And stranger still, lord , who discovered this bargain and sale, is offended at it, and insists on the dismission of this lord of the treasury.
Now, sir, I must entreat you to favour one of your constituents with the name of this lord of the treasury; for you, no doubt, who sit at that board yourself, must be acquainted with him.
A FREEHOLDER OF SURREY.
TO THE RIGHT HON. GEORGE ONSLOW.
GOOD SIR,
IF with another innocent man, lord Holland, you, too, were ambitious to add to the list of Mr. Walpole's right honourable authors, you might, like him, have exposed yourself with more temper, and have called names in better English.
I should be sorry to libel you by mistaking your meaning, but the strange manner of wording your first sentence leaves me at a loss to know whether you intend that my letter, or your own character 'is a gross and infamous lie from beginning to end.' You may save yourself the expense of taking 'the best advice in the law.' Depend upon it you can never 'hope to make an example of the author, when the publisher is unable or unwilling to give up his name.' And you need not wait for a jury to determine, that 'robbing a man is certainly a robbery.' But you should have considered, some months since, that it is the same thing whether the man be guilty or innocent; and whether he be robbed of his reputation or of his seat in parliament. In the Public Advertiser of Friday, July 14, there is a letter from you as well as to you. If that is the scurrility you speak of, I agree with you, that it has been treated with the contempt it deserves by all the world; but how you can say that it has passed with impunity I own I cannot conceive, unless, indeed, you are of opinion with those hardened criminals who think that, because there is no corporal sufferance in it, the being gibbetted in chains, and exposed as a spectacle, makes no part of their punishment.
The letter written by you to Mr. Wilkes, tends more 'to wound your character and honour' than any other, and yet you pass it over in silence. But you shall, if you please, prove to the world, that those who have neither character nor honour, may still be wounded in a very tender part their interest. And I believe lord Hillsborough is too noble to suffer any lord of the treasury to prostitute his name and commission to bargains like that I have exposed; but will, if he continues to preside at the board of trade, resolutely insist either on such lord's full justification or dismission.
The language of the last part of this sentence is such as I can make no use of, and therefore I return it back on you to whom it belongs: the defiance in the first part I accept, and will disprove what you say.
My letter can only be false in one particular, for it contains only one affirmation, namely, that I heard the story I relate from very good authority. It then concludes with a question to you of ï¿½ who is this lord of the treasury that so abhors corruption? Which question since you have answered, I too will gratify you, and, in return for yours, do hereby direct the printer to give you my name; which, humble as it is, I should not consent to exchange with you in any other manner.
Now, sir, I do again affirm, that 1 heard the story from the best authority: and that it is not my invention your own letter is a proof, for I might have heard it either from Mrs. Burns, or from Mr. Pownall, or Mr. Bradshaw, but I heard it from better authority. I go farther, I do still believe the story, as I related it, to be true; nor has any thing you have said convinced me to the contrary. I do not mean to charge you or any one; but since you have condescended to answer my former question, be kind enough to explain what follows.
Mr. Pownall is secretary to the board of trade. Mr. Bradshaw is secretary to the treasury. Why did these secretaries come together to you? Were they sent by their principals or not? Who first detected this very scandalous, though very common traffic? Has not lord Hillsborough that honour? And is not your exaggerated 'abhorrence of corruption, your astonishment, and indeed horror at this shocking scene of villainy,' vastly heightened by the calm, and therefore unsuspected disapprobation of his lordship; who does not seem to think with you, that every whore should be hanged alive; but only that they should be TURNED OUT of honest company.
How came you so instantly to entertain hopes of getting the money restored to Mrs. Burns? when you declared, that 'till that morning, you never in your life heard a single word of either the office itself, nor of any of the parties concerned.' Jonathan Wild used to return such answers, because he knew the theft was committed by some of his own gang.
You pretend to have given to the public 'all the knowledge you have of this detestable fraud.' I cannot believe it, because I find nothing in your letter on which to ground your hopes of restoring the money to Mrs. Burns; and, especially, because in three weeks after this letter, i. e. from June 27, to July 18, you have only discovered, that 'Mrs. Smith appears to be principally concerned in this detestable fraud, the money being it seems for her use.' Sir, do you not know whose Mrs. Smith is? And are you not acquainted with that gentleman? Have you caused Mrs. Smith, or any one else, to be taken into custody? Have you taken ' the best advice in the law, and are you determined to see if a jury will
not do you and the public justice' for this detestable fraud? Or is there yet left one crime which you abhor more than corruption; and for which you reserve all your indignation?
But why this anger? He that is innocent can easily prove himself to be so; and should be thankful to those who give him the opportunity by making a story public. Malicious and false 'slander never acts in this open manner; but seeks the covert, and cautiously conceals itself from the party maligned, in order to prevent a justification.
If any persons have done your character an injury by a charge of corruption, they are most guilty who so thoroughly believed you capable of that crime, as to pay a large sum of money on the supposition: (an indignity which I protest I would not have offered to you, though you had negotiated the matter, and given the promise yourself.) And yet I do not find you at all angry with them when they tell you their opinion of you without scruple. On the contrary, you pity Mrs. Burns in the kindest manner, which shows plainly that your honour is not like Caesar's wife. Nay, you seem almost to doubt, whether you 'might beg the favour of Mr. Burns to meet you at your house in Curzon Street;' that is, you humbly solicit Mr. Burns to do you the favour of accepting your assistance in the recovery of his money. Archbishop Laud thought to clear himself to posterity from all aspersions relative to popery, by inserting in his Diary his refusal of a cardinal's hat, not perceiving the disgrace indelibly fixed on him by the offer. 'Mr. Burns has had the strongest recommendations from persons of undoubted veracity, and I believe on all accounts will be found to be perfectly capable and worthy of the employment. The letter from Mrs. Burns to you does, by no means, declare her to be an idiot.
Colonel (whom you forbear to mention,) is a man of sense, and well acquainted with the world. It is strange they should all three believe you capable of this crime, which,' of all others, you most hold in abhorrence.'
Mr. Pownall, Mr.Bradshaw, and their principals, are supposed to know something of men and things, and therefore I conclude they did not believe you concerned in this business: though I wonder much, that, not believing it, both the secretaries should wait on you so seriously about it; but perhaps they may think that when honour and justice are not the rules of men's actions, there is nothing incredible that may be for their advantage.
But, sir, whatever may be their sentiments of you, I must entreat you to entertain no resentment to me. My opinion of your character would never suffer me to doubt your innocence. If, indeed, the charge of corruption had been brought against a low and ignorant debauchee, who, without the gratifications and enjoyments of a gentleman, had wasted a noble patrimony amongst the lowest prostitutes; whose necessities had driven him to hawk about a reversion on the moderate terms of one thousand for two hundred; whose desperate situation had made him renounce his principles and desert his friends, those principles and those friends to which he stood indebted for his chief support; who, for a paltry consideration, had stabbed a DEAR OLD FRIEND, and violated the sacred rights of that grateful country that continued to the son the reward of his father's services. If the charge had been brought against such an one, more fit to receive the public charity than to be trusted with the disposal and management of the public money, small proof would have been sufficient; and, instead of considering it as a crime the most to be abhorred, we might have suffered corruption to pass amongst the virtues- of such a man.
But yours, sir, is a very different character and situation, in the clear and unencumbered possession of that paternal estate with which your ancestors have long been respectable; with a pension of three thousand, and a place of one thousand a year; with the certain prospect of lord O 's large fortune, which your prudence will not anticipate; grateful to your country, faithful to your connexions, and firm to your principles, it ought to be as difficult to convict you of corruption as a cardinal of fornication; for which last purpose, by the canon law, no less than seventy-two eye-witnesses are necessary.
Thus, sir, you see how far I am from casting any reflection on your integrity: however, if, notwithstanding all I have said, you are still resolved to try the determination of a jury, take one piece of advice from me: do not think of prosecuting me for an insinuation: alter your charge before it comes upon record, to prevent its being done afterwards; for though lord Mansfield did not know the difference between the words when he substituted the one for the other, we all know very well now that it is the tenor, and not the purport, that must convict for a libel, which, indeed, almost every student in the law knew before.
A Freeholder of Surrey.
TO MR. WILKES.
Monday, Jan. 14, 1771.
SIR,
An agent of yours declared, some time ago, that it would be useful to you and your affairs to come to an open rupture with me. ï¿½ From this opinion has flowed all the abuse which has lately been bestowed upon me in the public papers. I believe you have mistaken a strong inclination for policy, and have yielded to a natural bias, in opposition to honesty and your interest. For near three weeks past, I have been pretty closely confined to my chamber by indisposition, and, except the 'Public Advertiser,' have only seen such papers as my friends have brought to me, whose kindness made them feel, more sensibly than myself, the injuries you have offered me. I have hitherto seen very little worthy of an answer, except the particular charges in the 'Gazetteer' of last Tuesday. I think it due to the public, to my friends, and myself, to give to each as particular an answer. Sir, as I have never, either in public or private life, copied your example ï¿½ I shall not do it in this my justification. Instead of a defence, your method has always been to recriminate. On the contrary, I shall, in this letter, confine myself to the charges brought against me. In a future letter, I will explain the nature and causes of the differences between us : they ought to be made public, because the objects are not private.
The Westminster business I shall reserve for my future letter, because it is one of the pretended causes of difference. The other charges, I think, are, ï¿½ 1. That ï¿½I subscribed to the  Society of the Bill of Rights, but never paid one shilling.' ï¿½ 2. That 'I have received amazing sums for Mr. serjeant Glynn's elections, ten guineas each from most of his friends.' ï¿½ 3. That I have received subscriptions for the widow Bigby's appeal.' ï¿½ 4. That 'I have received subscriptions for Mr. Gillam's trial.' ï¿½ 5. That 'I have received subscriptions for the affair of the weavers in Spital Fields.'
These five charges I understand to be of a public nature. After which, there is a charge upon me of a private fraud, in a story about Mr. Foote's pamphlet, and Messrs. Davis, thebooksellers.
These particular charges I undertake to answer, and if there is any other that I hav omitted to take notice of, you will please to remind me of it. If there is any other that you have omitted, you have my free leave to bring it.
First, I never did subscribe any thing to the' Society of the Bill of Rights.' It is true, that, in the accounts of that society, there will be found five guineas of my money; but these five guineas were paid by me at the moment of subscribing them, at the last subscription made at the King's Arms Tavern, in Cornhill, some time before the establishment of the society at the London Tavern. Nor do I recollect, at any time, to have subscribed any money without instantly paying down the small, but numerous sums, I have contributed. These poor five guineas were received, and the account of them brought into the society by
The second charge is, 'The amazing sums received by me for Mr. Glynn's election; ten guineas each from most of his friends.' The subject of this charge, no doubt, puts me in a delicate and difficult situation, because the particulars of it ought to be discussed only by Mr. Glynn and the subscribers; and I am
bound to be very careful, that, whilst I justify myself, I do not say any thing which may give pain or displeasure to others. However, I think I can say enough on this head to satisfy the most scrupulous, without hurting the most tender. I must premise, that I have always carefully avoided three things; I
mean the being placed upon any public occasion in any situation of honour, trust, or profit, from which my name, and my station, and my inclination, equally dissuaded me. I have been regularly and indefatigably the drudge of almost every popular election, prosecution, and public business, ï¿½ but never the object of any one. For three years past my time has been entirely, and my income almost wholly, applied to public measures. But, though with great caution, and sometimes obstinacy, I have
taken care never to be the chairman of any company, nor the ostensible manager or conductor of any matter; yet I have not been able to avoid being, on three occasions, the receiver of money. One of them was the election of Mr. Glynn. But there were no amazing sums in the case. The ten guinea subscription amounted to two hundred and sixty-two pounds ten shillings, of which, for want of a more diligent collector than myself, only two hundred and twenty pounds ten shillings have yet been received; and that sum has been paid away long ago either by me or by Mr. B , the treasurer of that subscription. Mr. Glynn, and the subscribers, must examine and settle that business; and, if they have no objection, I am sure I shall have none, to lay each particular article before the public.
ï¿½ And now, I have answered this charge as far as you have brought it, I desire to strengthen the charge, by informing you, sir, that there was another subscription for Mr. Glynn's election. (Indeed the ten guineas were not subscribed for the expenses of Mr. Glynn in his election, nor was any subscription for that purpose intended; the ten guineas were subscribed to pay the expenses of some dinners which about twenty of us agreed to give to the freeholders, in different parts of the county, in the summer, whilst Mr. Glynn was on the circuit.) ï¿½ The second subscription was made only after the riot on the first day of election, in order to pay the additional expenses incurred by that most villainous action, it seeming very cruel and unjust that so barbarous and wicked a contrivance should increase the
expense to Mr. serjeant Glynn of a contest already sufficiently expensive, and which had, been carried on about seven months against all the powers and influence of government. This second subscription amounted to 1401ï¿½., 981ï¿½. of which have been paid; 420ï¿½. still remain unpaid. Of this money, 400ï¿½. were paid into the hands of Mr. Vaughan, the treasurer on this occasion; 340ï¿½. 10. were paid into the hands of Messrs. Lowry and Co., bankers, in Lombard Street: 24Oï¿½. 10s. were collected by me, from time to time, as the subscribers fell in my way, and were paid again by me as occasion and opportunity offered: I likewise drew on Messrs. Lowry and Co. for the money in their hands, with which I paid the demands on Mr, Glynn, as far as the money would reach them. On this point I can only say, as before, that, if Mr. Glynn and the subscribers have no objection, I shall have none, to lay each particular article of receipt and payment before the public.
The third charge is, 'That I have received subscriptions for the widow Bigby's appeal.' The widow Bigby's appeal was not brought by my direction; I do not mean that I disapprove it; I commend the measure; and, if I had been applied to, should have advised it. I think the pardon granted to the murderers of Bigby was a horrid one, I think the same of the pardon granted to M'Quirk, and I do not believe either of them lawful. Mr. Stamford, the attorney who was employed by the widow, applied to a gentleman of character and fortune in the city for assistance; that gentleman brought Mr. Stamford to me, who told me what he had done, and what he in-tended to do; but he declared himself unable to bear the expense and go on with the appeal, unless he was assisted immediately with money.
I undertook the matter, made myself answer-able to him, and assisted him with money; and when I saw my friends, I applied to them for their help, because I was unequal to the burden alone. I did not indeed foresee that any member of the house of commons would move for leave to bring in a bill to take away the right of appeal from the people in cases of murder; but I did foresee that lord Mansfield would make such a motion and such a bill unnecessary; and that he would, by studied delays and difficulties, most effectually take away the remedy of appeal, by showing us that the most eminent counsel at the bar are
not able to proceed in such a course as to bring it to a trial: and I supposed that he would, as he has done, so protract the matter, by shifting his difficulties and his doubts, that either the proceedings on the appeal should be dropped, from the enormity of the expense, or the obstinate virtue of the poor
appellant have time to be cooled and corrupted. I expected only to show, what has been shown, that lord Mansfield, who is so dexterous at removing difficulties and shortening the way to a conviction for libel, according to the modern method of prosecution, is as dexterous in finding out or creating obstacles to a trial in the ancient mode of appeal for murder, which was formerly the subject's only remedy. And for this purpose I was willing, and did declare my willingness, to bear, if it was necessary, the whole expense of the prosecution. The few friends to whom I spoke on this occasion were of the same sentiments; and they contributed towards the appeal. I afterwards found that good man, Sir , was as warm in this business as myself; at his desire I waited on him, and as he was anxious to be a sharer in the burden, I some time after sent a gentleman to him with a list of the subscribers, and an account of the money paid to the attorney, and solicited him earnestly to be the treasurer on this occasion. Sir , for many reasons, excused him-self. Very lately this office has been kindly accepted by Mr. Tooke. He has the list and the account, and the trouble of collecting the subscriptions. I do not desire any part of it to be kept secret. I have received 100ï¿½. l6s., and I have paid to the attorney 150ï¿½.; and I have never been less in advance than I am at present, which is 39ï¿½. 4s. 
The fourth charge is, 'That I have received subscriptions for Mr. Gillam's trial.' A copy of his indictment was illegally granted to Mr. Gillam, in order to intimidate and disgrace another gentleman and myself. When the request was made, the judges were at first divided: Mr. justice Aston and Mr. Recorder saw no objection to it, and they at last over-persuaded the lord chief baron Parker: Mr. justice Gould refused it to the last. Notwithstanding this copy of the indictment, I have never hesitated to declare, that I did promote and assist that prosecution to the utmost of my power; but I did not at any time receive a farthing from any person on the account of Mr, Gillam's trial, or any thing relative to it, and I do assert that there was no subscription for it. If you, sir, can discover a single person who paid any subscription to me, or to any other, on that account, it is your business to name him; otherwise we shall know how to name von.
The fifth charge is, 'That I have received subscriptions for the affair of the weavers in Spital Fields.' I never did receive any subscription for the affair of the weavers in Spital Fields; there never was any subscription on that account, or on any other, relative to the weavers in Spital Fields. I took no small pains, with other gentlemen, to save the lives of some innocent men; but though one was petitioned
for by the lord mayor and all the aldermen Who sat on the bench at his trial, with the strongest circumstances in his favour, and though another was unanimously and strongly recommended to mercy by the jury, they were both hanged. ï¿½ Their crime was not murder. ï¿½ I believe we had better success in
our endeavours to stop the further merciless persecution of that unhappy body of men; but what we did was done without collecting money or subscription; and I do not believe that any money was paid, except twenty pounds, which I gave, out of my own pocket, towards procuring counsel for one Baker, a journeyman weaver, whom lord Mansfield had refused to admit to bail till term-time, and till after hearing counsel; although the same lord Mansfield confessed that he was committed on a charge for an offence bailable at the very first view, and which did not admit even the shadow of a doubt. If any person did subscribe on this account to me or to any other, it is your business to name him.
Thus, sir, I have answered your five charges concerning subscriptions. Three of them (one said to be left unpaid by me, and two said to have been received by me) are totally false; there never were any such subscriptions. The other two, I hope, I have likewise answered to your dissatisfaction. Though the proof of such charges ought to rest upon him who brings them, yet I think I may venture safely to take even the opposite proof on myself; for I trust, however disagreeable it is to gentlemen to put their names in the papers, I trust Mr. Richard Oliver, who is treasurer to the ' Society of the Bill of Rights,' and Mr. serjeant Glynn, and Mr. Tooke, will do me that justice which is due to me, and add the authority of their names to the truth of what I have related.
But, sir, there is one subscription more that I have received, and with which you have not charged me; I mean a subscription of 94ï¿½. 17.9d. raised for you in my neighbourhood, which I have brought into the society very lately, at the last meeting but one at the London Tavern. This subscription I did not collect; it was only conveyed by me to the society. It was collected publicly in an open book, by Mr. B. Hï¿½ , Mr. B , Mr. D , Mr. H , of my parish, and this book was brought back to me only the day before I delivered it in: however, before this subscription, I advanced, in the payment of demands upon you, 38ï¿½. 0. 8d., which I am still to receive, and, of the subscription itself, seven guineas still remain unpaid to me.
Your last charge is, that I have received money for different publications, and you call upon me to lay before the public an account of the profits on my vamped up sermon, Mr. Foote's apology, Mr. Missing's letter, &c. as selling, at the same time, that I defrauded Mr. Foote of forty or fifty pounds, which I took from Messrs. Davis the booksellers; and you bid me give you the evidence of Mr. Davis, both the father and the son, and Mr. Foote's justification of my disinterested friendship to him.
Have you forgotten in how unmanly a manner you lately received the very manly behaviour of Mr. alderman Trecothick, when you were charged with the illiberal anonymous abuse cast on that gentleman in 'the annals of his mayoralty? ï¿½Annals of three or four months! ï¿½If you thought yourself justified in refusing to acknowledge to the injured person an anonymous writing, how can you expect that I should give you an answer about pamphlets that bear other men's names? It is true, I have always avowed whatever I have written anonymously, whenever any person has complained that he was injured; as in the cases of sir John Gibbons, sir W. B. Proctor, Mr.Onslow, &c.; it is my general rule when I am treated fairly; but the rule does not extend to you; for, in those pamphlets, even if I had written them, there is no reflection upon you: when you attribute to me the pamphlets that bear the names of other men, and call for an answer, you are impertinent to me and injurious to them. Perhaps some other person may think it as probable that you should have written the sermon, as that I should have written on subjects of law and surgery. I know, indeed, how you will solve that difficulty, by declaring that there is as little divinity in the one, as law and surgery in the others. Sir, I shall only answer you what you must already suppose, viz. that, of all the pamphlets I ever wrote in my life, I have regularly received the profits; and of all the pamphlets which I may hereafter write, I shall, if I please, regularly receive the profits.
But, that you may not envy me the amazing sums I have likewise received on that score, I will tell you exactly to what they amount; and, that I might be exact, I have settled accounts which were never before settled. Of all the things I ever wrote in my life the profits amount to a sum not sufficient to furnish you with two month's claret.
For the fraud with which you charge me on Mr. Foote, through Messrs. Davis, the booksellers, it is a falsi mod, and you ought to be told so in coarser language. You bid me give you the evidence of Mr. Davis, both the father and the son, and of Mr. Foote. You, who bring the charge, should take the onus pro-bandi! I can only give my own evidence.
They must, if they please, give theirs for themselves. But why this Judaism, sir? Why will not Mr. Davis the father satisfy you? Why visit the sins of the fathers upon the children?
Sir, I will be bold to say, the further and the more particularly you sift into every part of my conduct, the more honourable it will appear; for very many circumstances will come out necessarily in my defence, which could not otherwise have been mentioned without boasting; and I defy all your art and all your abilities to make me, whilst I am honest, either detestable or ridiculous. However, you must now do something, for your credit's sake: at least be witty, at least entertain the public: scraps of verses will not all together answer the purpose. ï¿½ Ah me! is no argument; quotations are not proofs. But if you will quote an incomparable poet, you should take some of his incomparable poetry. With such a choice of beauties before you, to select the passages with which you have lately patched your prose, convinces me that no friend can escape you; and that, living or dead, it is your study and endeavour to show, if you can, their weak sides to the public.
John Horne.
