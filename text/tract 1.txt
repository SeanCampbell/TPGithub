I have neither leisure nor abilities to undertake a regular definition of the Law of Nature, with all the doctrines usually ranked under that head: and indeed, if I had both leisure and abilities, I should want inclination; because such a work unavoidably become voluminous, on account of the variety of authors necessary to be mentioned, who have treated the subject with different views: and as all science is vain, which is not reduced to practice, so the more voluminous any subject is rendered, the less it can be useful, on account of the increased difficulty of communicating it to the generality of readers. I have therefore confined my tract to such general remarks of the subject, as are most necessary for the observation of my countrymen at large, with respect (more particularly) to one point, viz. the Illegality of reducing or subjecting mankind to involuntary servitude, either under political or private dominion: as all pretensions to an unlimited authority of any man or men over others, are contrary to Natural Equity and the Laws of God, as well as baneful to mankind in general; which effect is unhappily demonstrated by the numberless instances of unnatural oppression now prevailing to the destruction of mankind, in almost every part of the world. I have already shown in my answer to the Rev. Mr. Thompson (ad advocate for the African slave trade) that the Jewish constitutions were not strictly consistent with the Law of Nature in all points; and consequently, that they are not to be considered as the rule by which lawyers and casuists may safely determine �what is, or what is not, according to Nature.�
The Law of Nature has been variously represented; but all the best writers, both ancient and modern, agree in adopting that maxim of the Civil Institutes, which declares involuntary servitude, or slavery, to be �contrary to the Law of Nature:� this rule is commonly understood as applicable only to domestic slavery; but it is equally true when applied to political oppression, or the exercise of an unlimited dominion over a whole nation. Some few authors indeed have been so unreasonable, as to assert that �there is no such thing as natural Law;� but they are properly censured by the Learned Baron Puffendorf in his �Law of Nature and Nations.� Book 2. Chap. 3.
He particularly mentions the argument of Carniades as contracted by Lactantius to the following effect.
Such doctrine is certainly very convenient for Tyrants and Slaveholders of every degree, who must otherwise remain without excuse, whenever �the Law of Nature,� and �the Common Rights of Humanity,� are urged against them: it is therefore necessary for them, either to misrepresent the Law of Nature (as Mr. Thompson has done), or else (like Carniades) utterly to deny its existence. This latter method has been also adopted by some modern advocates for Slavery, who, in private discourse on this subject, have declared, that they esteem �the Law of Nature� to be no other than their natural propensity to pursue their own heart�s desire of profit or pleasure: and this they call �natural Liberty;� though it certainly is the most unnatural Tyranny: for when the immutable necessity of reciprocal consideration is forgot, or set aside, there can be no safety among men, and consequently no natural Liberty: we must, therefor, submit ourselves to be the servants of law, in order to be truly free; according to the excellent observation of Cicero. We may learn from the histories of all nations, that Lust, Avarice, Pride, Revenge, Love of Power, Jealousy, &c. are Principles of Action, which unavoidably produce oppression and wrongs, to the destruction of the human species, in all places where will and pleasure (whether in political or private dominion) are supreme; or whenever Self-love and Private Interest become entirely predominant among men. That Self-love is predominant with the generality of mankind is but too apparent; yet we are not, therefore, obliged to admit that �Self-love� is �the universal principal of action;� though an eminent and learned law-writer has (with very good intentions, as his argument proves) thought proper to give it that title.
�Honesty (indeed) is the best policy,� even for a selfish man to pursue; and, it is certain, that the solid attainments of virtue and justice afford a real and substantial satisfaction, which in the end most amply fulfills the purposes of Self-love.
But though Virtue and Honesty are thus favourable to Self-love in their natural effects, this, by no means, proves that Self-love is the motive of all virtuous and honest men; or that it is the �universal principle of action:� for, if that were really the case, many of the most amiable virtues must be esteemed mere empty names. There could be no true Generosity or Benevolence; no Disinterested Goodness of heart; no sincere Natural Affection between parents and their children, husbands and their wives, brethren, friends, &c. whereas history affords many undoubted instances of Self-love being lost in the superior affections, natural to generous minds, in all these different degrees of connection; but it is needless to recite them, since, even in the brute creation there are natural affections superior to Self-love.
The common hen is so inflamed with Natural Affection, and anxious care for her tender brood, that she seems to have as little sense of Self-love in time of danger, as of her own weakness; for she will boldly fly in the face of every invader (except man) however superior in size or strength to herself.
The timorous cow, it is said, will attack the fiercest tiger, when her calf is by her side. Many instances of very extraordinary Affection in dogs to their masters have been well attested. Those faithful animals have sometimes been known to lose all sense of danger to themselves in the necessary defence of their owners. And the very swine discover such a Natural Affection and real sympathy for their brethren of the sty, whenever they hear their cries of distress, that their example ought to shame the depraved part of mankind (imperial tyrants and royal robbers, who extend their dominion by breach of faith, unlawful invasion, murder and rapine, as also those petty tyrants and destroyers of mankind the African traders, and American slaveholders) lest the affectionate brute, notwithstanding his sensuality, should seem, on comparison, a more generous, and therefore a more noble animal than that Man, who stifles all Natural Affection, Fellow-feeling, and Charity to his kind, merely for the sake of acquiring power, or worldly profit to himself; and surely a time will come, when all such offenders against the Law of Nature (who prefer the wages of unrighteousness to the natural dictates of Humanity and Conscience) will have reason to esteem the lot of the most contemptible brute infinitely more eligible than their own!
Now as it appears that �Self-love� is not the �universal principle of Action� even in brutes, much less ought it to be esteemed so in mankind, because the human soul (besides the Natural Affection which men ought to have in common with other creatures) is endowed with a much more noble principle, or motive to good actions, I mean Reason, or that �Knowledge of good and evil,� which we inherit from our first parents, and which they unlawfully took upon themselves, at the instigation of their spiritual enemy, that they might thereby be rendered accountable for all their actions, and, through Knowledge become guilty before God!
The history of that fatal transaction demands our most careful consideration, since all mankind are particularly affected by it! And surely the principles of our own Nature are subjects of enquiry infinitely more important to us, than all the other branches of natural Philosophy; and yet perhaps they are less examined by men of science, and consequently are less understood, than any other! but in vain is the most accurate knowledge of plants, drugs, fossils, and minerals; or of the exact revolutions of the heavenly bodies, and of the nature and properties of all the elements, &c. if the philosopher in unacquainted with himself and the properties and state of his own soul, which is too often the case! Knowledge, in all the former particulars, is indeed honourable and praise-worthy, but, in the latter, it is indispensable; for when men, through ignorance of the compound Nature of man, slight the common means, which God has revealed, to guard their minds against intellectual deceptions, they are sure to be perverted in their principles to the imminent danger both of body and soul! Such an one, probably, thinks himself too judicious a critic to admit the Mosaic account of the subject now before us, viz. the Fall of man; at least in the literal sense of the text: so that the doctrines, which I propose to collect from it, will have very little weight, I fear, with men of that stamp. Nevertheless, as there are many doctrines in other parts of Scripture, which corroborate the literal meaning of that relation, and as there are also several circumstances discoverable in the Nature of Man, which cannot otherwise be reasonably accounted for, I must beg my readers to excuse me, even if they think me too prolix in my examination of that part of the sacred history, which I conceive to be absolutely necessary for the obtaining a true practical idea of the Law of Nature, and the Principles of Action in Man. 
God delivered a clear and express Law to Man before the fall; and then follows the denunciation of punishment;
This was the first and only penal Law; A FORFEITURE OF LIFE! And though we find afterwards, that the declared punishment was not immediately executed according to the letter (that is, the penalty of death was not inflicted on the day of the transgression, as it seemed to be at first ordained) yet this affords no just exception against the truth and propriety of the relation.
The same ALMIGHTY BEING, who had a right (as all things are his own) to prohibit the action above mentioned, and to assign a punishment for disobedience, had certainly a right also to respite, or postpone, or even to remit (if he had been pleased to do so) the execution of the Law which he himself had ordained. But for the present it is sufficient to remark, that the nature of the penalty had been clearly revealed to our first parents, and was as clearly understood by them, so that they were sufficiently sensible of their obligation to observe the said Law, previous to their breach of it: which plainly appears by the speech of the woman to the tempter, viz.
After so clear an acknowledgement of the divine precept, the act of taking the fruit (which otherwise in itself would, probably, have been no crime) was certainly a willful sin of a very heinous nature, being a gross contempt of God�s word, for which our first parents very justly incurred the penalty of death, which, they were previously told, must be the consequence of disobedience.
They had received this caution even from God himself, whom they knew to be their Maker and Supreme Lord; and yet the unwary woman unhappily listened to an assertion, that was absolutely contradictory to her Creator�s word, and thereby drew upon herself, an all her descendants, the irrevocable doom to labour! � pain! � and mortality!
Perhaps the naughty philosopher will now be ready to arraign the justice of the divine decree, which involved the innocent progeny (that is, innocent with respect to this particular crime) in the punishment of their guilty parents; but if he will patiently follow me through this examination of Human Nature, he will, perhaps, be able to form a better idea of the Nature of original Sin, and of the cause of its being intailed, (or rather the effects of its being intailed) on all the descendants of Adam. For the immediate effects of that original Sin of our first parents, was the acquisition of an additional faculty (even of a divine attribute) to the Nature of Man, which of course descends from these original stocks by natural inheritance to all their progeny, and thereby inevitably involves them all in the same condemnation; the manner of which shall be more particularly explained hereafter This very ancient example of punishment for a contempt of God�s word (the direful effects of which, labour, pain, and mortality, are ever before us) should teach mankind the extreme danger of paying attention to any doctrines and interpretations of Law or Religion, that have the least tendency to oppose or contradict the literal or most obvious meaning of God�s word; for the efforts of our spiritual Enemy are never more baneful, than when he is pleased to assume the office of a commentator on the Laws of God; in which character he is frequently discoverable; for though he does not now present himself outwardly or apparently, as at first, in the assumed shape of a serpent, yet the venom of his doctrines is too often sufficiently distinguishable, both in the writings and discourse of men! And it is remarkable, that his first attempt against mankind should be in the capacity of a critic on the Divine Law! The influence of spiritual enemies is indeed a distinct Principle of Action in Man, which shall be more particularly mentioned in the course of this Tract.
But to return to the first fatal instance, before mentioned, of Satan�s success, in misleading mankind, which occasioned another distinct Principle of Action in Man.
It appears that the Tempter was well acquainted with the true nature and effects of the forbidden fruit, which he declared, indeed, but not without uttering, at the same time, a notorious falsehood. 
Now this acquisition of Knowledge, which the Tempter promised, was really such as he represented it, viz. a Divine Attribute (�Ye shall become as gods, knowing Good and Evil�);-so that, in this one respect, indeed, his intelligence was true: for the inspired historian has recorded also the words of God himself to the same effect: But truth is much more deceitful and dangerous, even than falsehood itself, when, for the purpose of misleading, it is maliciously blended with the latter; for notwithstanding the Deceiver�s flattering assurance to our first parents, that they should �not die;� yet in the very day (as it seems) of their transgression, they heard the tremendous sentence of misery and death pronounced against them! And though it was not then finally executed, as they had reason to expect it would, according to the tenor of the Law before declared, on which the judgment was founded, (for God never judges men without Law, like the arbitrary princes of this world) yet the said Law, by which their lives were expressly forfeited, was sufficiently fulfilled by the condemnation of the transgressors (on the very day of their offence) to mortality; whereby their once immortal bodies were rendered continually liable to diseases, injuries, misery, and death, as the bodies of all the descendants have ever since been! and they were no longer entitled even to the food necessary for the support of their poor mortal bodies, without severe labour, care, and assiduity! 
These have ever since been the conditions of human life; and though some men, who have store of worldly goods, endeavor to cast away care, and seem to live in a state of opposition to this general rule, yet they only deceive themselves; for no descendant of Adam, be he ever so rich, has any right to eat the bread of idleness; nor can he do so without offence against his own soul, as well as against this universal ordinance of God. �If Providence has afforded him wealth and leisure, he is accountable for both; being only a steward for life; after which, the performance of his duty to God, to his country, to his neighbours, nay, to mankind in general, his brethren of the universe, will be strictly scrutinized, and punished in proportion to the degree of his willful neglect and disobedience; since nothing is more clearly revealed, than that all mankind lie under an indispensable obligation to improve their talents for all these duties, as well as to use them whenever there is an opportunity; so that the man who neglects to employ, in these services, a due portion of that leisure, which his rank, or situation in life affords him, may justly be said to misspend his Master�s time, for it is not his own: and such an one must inevitably suffer with the �unprofitable servant,� described in the Gospel, who neglected to improve his talent; - See the whole parable from the 14th verse, whereby it plainly appears, that mankind are laid under an indispensable necessity to improve their respective natural talents, to the best of their power, for the Lord�s service.
The affluence, and unemployed leisure, therefore, of many person, whom we daily see amongst us, afford no just exception to God�s general ordinance concerning the hard conditions of human life. It is almost too obvious to be mentioned, that riches and hereditary honours procure no exemption from the most material part of that sentence, viz. �to dust thou shalt return!� And that the time and manner of that returning to the dust, or to the ground, is equally unknown to the rich and to the poor, though to both equally certain: so that no man, not the greatest or most independent, can claim even a single day before-hand as his own. Wherefore, with respect also to the other part of the punishment for the original sin (viz. the doom to labour) let those men, who think themselves exempted, by their rank and fortunes, from the necessity of employment; who think they have a right to spend their time, as well as their money, just as they please, for their own amusement and mere self-satisfaction; and seem to enjoy leisure and ease, as if God�s general ordinance to all mankind had been partial, or of none effect! Let such men, I say, be reminded of the alarming dreadful sentence pronounced by �the Lord of the vineyard� in the parable. How absurd therefore is the pride of those men, who value themselves on account of territorial authority (whether public or private) and yet live as if the importance, which they assume in right of landed possessions, or hereditary rank in life, might of intself be esteemed a sufficient merit without the cultivation of any other! But let them remember, that there is a �Lord of the vineyard,� to whom all things belong, and to whom a strict account must be rendered of every trust, and of every possession, whether of lands, or of governments: so that the dominions and estates of all temporal lords and landowners (be their right of tenure ever so unexceptionable among men) are yet so far from being their own, that even they themselves, whenever they acquire a habit of misspending their time and wealth, are justly esteemed as INCUMBRANCES upon that very ground, in which all their imaginary consequence is planted! Now, shall we envy the rich man�s enjoyment of unemployed leisure, if this be the consequence? Far better had it been for such a person to have endured, with the meanest labourer, the common lot of man, and in the sweat of his face to have eat his bread, than thus to have lived an unworthy exception to the general decree, thereby rendering himself in the sight of God, as one that �cumbereth the ground!� It would be well for mankind, if the consideration of this sentence might be esteemed also a general Principle of Action; but, alas! we are all too apt to misspend our time in some degree; yet it is a failing to which the rich are more particularly liable. They are not compelled by necessity, like other men, to think for themselves; and from thence a fatal, inconsiderate notion is too apt to prevail among them, viz. that their time is their own; and therefore, as they presume upon a supposed right to spend their leisure, according to their own Will and Pleasure, they necessarily misspend their substance also, for which they are equally accountable; and as riches are also the ordinary means of procuring the sweets and enjoyments of life, they are, consequently, a continual source of temptation, as well to acquire them unjustly, as to expend them improperly. From hence, probably, arises the extreme danger of riches to the spiritual welfare of mankind!
It is, nevertheless, through the additional faculty before-mentioned, which human nature acquired by the transgression of our first parents (viz. the Knowledge of Good and Evil) that Sin in imputed to us, whether we be rich or poor.
Our spiritual Enemy envied the happiness of mankind in their original state; and, therefore, artfully led them to the criminal usurpation of forbidden Knowledge, that they might, thereby, be rendered accountable to THE ETERNAL JUDGE for all their thoughts, word, and actions; and, through Knowledge, become guilty before God, and continually subject to Sin and Death! For this divine Knowledge obliges us (howsoever we act) to approve, at least, of virtuous actions, and to condemn vice; so that, when men transgress, it is, for the most part, knowingly, or willfully: and as �the strength of sin is the Law,� so the guilt of every criminal action is with justice imputed to us, because we have willfully offended against this natural Light, or LAW in our hearts, by which we ought to have known how �to refuse the evil, and chase the good.�
The Gentiles, without the knowledge of Scripture, nevertheless acknowledged this principle. 
Here the enlightened Heathen writer plainly acknowledges the Principle as natural to Mankind (- �Ratio summa, insita in Natura�) and yet esteemed it, at the same time, a divine Attribute, by some means imparted from God (- �recta, et a numine Deorum tracta Ratio�) though he might probably be unacquainted with the occasion of its being engraffed in Human Nature. He mentions this Attribute again, in his second Book de Natura Deorum, where he speaks of Prudence, or the choice of Good, and rejection of Evil, �as a universal Law common to God and Man.�
And in his first Book de Officiis, he more particularly defines the Law of Nature in Man, by describing the double bias of soul, viz. Appetite and Reason, and instead of laying down Appetite, or the Pursuit of Happiness, as the Rule of Obedience (which some very eminent and learned lawyers have done) he wisely reverses that rule, and thence forms an unexceptionable Rule of Action, viz. that Reason must rule, but Appetite obey.
He also clearly describes this natural instinct, �the Knowledge of Good and Evil,� under the title of Common Sense, �Communis Intelligentia,� and lays it down as the Law, or Rule of Nature (�Naturae Norma�) for distinguishing good Laws from bad, right from wrong, and honourable from base, which certainly is a much safer Principle to rely on than �Self-love.�
And the Apostle Paul has also given a strong testimony concerning the power and influence of this instinct, or first Principle planted in human Nature.
He informs us, that some men, who had not the written Law of God, were, nevertheless, capable of doing by Nature (or Instinct) the things contained in the Law-
This necessarily implies a natural Knowledge of Good and Evil, so that this divine faculty, or instinct in the Nature of Man, seems plainly to be the grand Principle, whereby men, who have �not the Law, are a Law unto themselves.� And this I apprehend to be, properly, �THE LAW OF NATURE� in MAN, the Law written on our hearts, or the Conscience, which bears witness with us, as the Apostle declares in the following verse: - Our �thoughts the mean while accusing, or else excusing us;� � for there are few men so bad, as not to have been, at some time or other, sensible of remorse, through the accusation above mentioned of their thoughts, or Conscience. For what are these thoughts which accuse and excuse, but Conscience itself; that is, the very same Principle, only differently expressed by the Apostle, for the sake of explanation? And again, this Conscience, which bears witness, is not a different, or distinct Principle from �the Knowledge of Good and Evil,� but only another name or mode or expressing the same Principle; or if it be so defined by some writers, as to appear in any degree different or distinct from the latter, it cannot, at most, be otherwise esteemed than as a different effect of that same Divine Knowledge: and the like may be said of Sinderesis as well as of �the Law of Reason;� both of which some authors have treated as distinct Principles from Conscience, notwithstanding that all these separate heads, Sinderesis, Reason, and Conscience, are necessarily resolved into one single principle or foundation, viz. �the Knowledge of good and Evil,� to which the enquirer is naturally led, in attempting to define them; for indeed this same indentical Principle or Power is equally attributed to them all. What is Sinderesis therefore, when thus explained, but the natural Knowledge in Man to reject the Evil, and chuse the Good? Reason is also explained by this celebrated author to the same effect:-
In the beginning of the Chapter, he expresses himself, as if he supposed that Man was indued with this divine faculty of Reason before the fall, even at the time �when he was created;� a doctrine which, certainly, is erroneous. That our first parents received from God, when they were first created, a due proportion of Reason suited to their original condition, is not to be doubted; there is no authority whatever to warrant the supposition of their being at first indued with that Perfection of Reason, that Attribute of a Divine and Spiritual Nature, which afterwards became natural to Man; though the worthy author apparently means this supreme degree of Reason, when he tells us, that Man, by the gift of Reason, is very plainly from the Scriptures, that this Perfection of Reason was afterwards acquired by unlawfully eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge; for it is plain, that the desire of acquiring Knowledge was part of the temptation to transgress: (�a tree to be desired to make one wise,� said the deluded Woman) and it was not until they had both of them eaten the forbidden fruit, that God said, �Behold, the Man is become AS ONE OF US, to know Good and Evil;� thereby plainly alluding to the Knowledge then newly acquired by the forbidden fruit; and they were driven out of the garden, we are expressly told, to prevent a further acquisition to the Nature of Man, viz. and therefore it is certain, that Man was not enlightened by the Divine Law of Reason within himself, when he was first created; or at least not with so great a share of it, as has since been justly attributed to Human Nature.
The third article which I have before mentioned, as a principle necessarily included in that divine Knowledge of Good and Evil, which our first parents unlawfully took upon themselves, is CONSCIENCE; and the ingenious author of Doctor and Student, before quoted, in describing the meaning of the word Conscience, has accordingly explained it exactly as if he had been defining the true purpose of the former Principle, the Divine Knowledge of Good and Evil. This is exactly the purpose of �the Knowledge of Good and Evil,� viz. that we should use it �as a light to discern what we ought to do, or ought not to do,� or, in Scripture words, that we �may know to refuse the Evil, and choose the Good.�
