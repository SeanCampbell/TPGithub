LETTER XII
January 18, 1775
�IT is," we are told, "to enable us to regulate the trade of the Americans, to restrict their navigation and manufactures, to bind them, and to exercise over
them every power whatever, except that of taking their money out of their pockets without their consent." But whence, I trow, do we derive any just authority for all these enormous pretensions? Not, I am persuaded, from
any part of that implied compact between governors and the governed, which, in reasoning upon just government, we must ever suppose and argue from, because the law of nature hath laid us under an eternal obligation so to do.
This compact, which none but tyrants will disclaim as a true criterion, evidently proves that, not only in taxation, but in making the laws by which every other part of the government is regulated, it is necessary the people do partake, either personally or by their representatives; otherwise, more or less, they will be slaves: and surely it is not in England, the very treading on whose happy soil changes a galley slave into a free man, that we shall inculcate doctrines, and enact laws to fix a real slavery in any degree on our kindred!  In the whole compass of argumentation, which hath of late been taken with regard to the respective rights of Britain and of British America, I am bold
to affirm, that no demonstration of the aforesaid rights, claimed by parliament, hath been given; and I must needs think that no demonstration of them can be given; but reasons sufficient have appeared to convince honest and thinking men, who are at all acquainted with the law of nature, and the spirit of our inestimable constitution, that such claims on our part are manifestly contrary to the rules of justice and the principles of freedom ; while those who have made history and human nature their study, will see as clearly that their direct tendency is to defeat the very ends, for the proposed attainment of which it is pretended they are urged. Who can conceive that a power so very loosely defined, so extremely extensive, and without a counterpoise; one which (notwithstanding the laboured distinctions vainly attempted) cannot but make very free with the pockets of the Americans, though not perhaps in the open and undisguised form of taxation, and in
which not one of the people, not one of the representatives of the people is to participate; a power which is to be lodged in the hands of a body of men residing beyond the ocean, having already more business at home than they
can or will execute to the satisfaction of their own countrymen? Who, I say, can conceive that such power in such hands can possibly, in the nature of things, be well administered, even in the most ordinary Instances? They
who can believe any thing so incredible, ought not hastily to pronounce plans they do not comprehend, or rather will not take the trouble to consider, to be visionary and ehimerical. To me it appears self-evident, that the exercise of such a power, how temperately, how cautiously soever, instead of extinguishing the resentments, and gaining the confidence of the Americans, must necessarily preserve alive their utmost jealousy and distrust; to produce with a moral certainty in their due time and regular order, complaint, dispute, opposition, and resistance; terminating finally, and probably at no great distance of time in defiance and contempt; all which fatal chain of consequences may be wholly prevented, as I have elsewhere shewn more at large, provided we will act justly, by anticipating their natural wishes, and aspirings after independency, with a desire of which they were inspired by
their Creator when he constituted them rational creatures and free agents; not to observe their feeling themselves to be, in their collective capacities, powerful nations, having within themselves the rights and actual powers of
a compleat legislation. He who perceives no signs of conviction in the countenances of those to whom he addresses himself, is apt to suppose he hath left untouched those particular arguments, on which the success of .his
discourse is principally to turn; when sometimes the fault is on the side of the auditors, whose passions and prejudices block up all the avenues to the judgment-seat of reason in the head, and the throne of truth in the heart,
so that even demonstrations and self-evident moral truths shall only enter at one ear, and go out at the other. So might I perhaps hope to convince, by continuing to write, did I not reflect that provided I have truth on my side.
I have already written enough; it now only remaining with my readers to convince themselves, by setting aside their passions and prejudices (particularly their lust of dominion, and their unjust, not to say unwise, selfishness) and by conscientiously appealing to their own understandings and hearts. There, if they will thus apply, I am persuaded they will find, to their great benefit and satisfaction, all the truths and motives to action, which are
necessary to give success to the cause I have humbly endeavoured to plead. I pretend not to force, but should be happy to win their assent; They must be willing converts; they must wish to be of my opinion; and bring their own love of truth, justice and freedom to my aid, or I shall certainly fail to be instrumental in removing their objections. I will therefore take leave of my subject, with a recapitulation only of the principal doctrines which, in the course of these letters, are advanced of argued from these then are amongst my positions:
1st, That the people of British America cannot lawfully be taxed, in any shape whatsoever, except in their own assemblies.
2dly, That a duty laid upon any article of our exports to them, and made payable before exportation, except they be at liberty to purchase the same article elsewhere, is a tax; and being not given and granted in their own.
assemblies but imposed by parliament, it is illegal.
3dly, That it is either a Weak or wicked conduct in those, who lay any stress on the ridiculous distinction, where there is no difference between internal and external taxes; since taxes are taxes, and all that is necessary to know is, whether they be legal or illegal.
4thly, That a parliamentary prohibition to manufacture their own iron and other commodities, together with an obligation to take them wrought from Great-Britain, and her only, at a greater charge than that at which they could
supply themselves by their own manufacture, is a tax, and therefore illegal.
5thly, That every parliamentary limitation of their trade and navigation, which operates to their disadvantage in a pecuniary sense is so much in the nature, although it may not come within the precise definition of a tax, that, (being an imposition) it is evidently illegal. 
6thly, That neither grants nor charters, precedents nor statutes; no, nor even the voluntary contract, the express act and engagement of the first planters of a distant, colony, can in the smallest degree impeach the rights of freedom in their descendants, whenever independency shall be their choice.
7thly, That it is a mistaken notion, that planting colonies and extending of empire are necessarily one and the same thing.
8thly, That it is in the very essence of liberty, that every state hath a right to choose its own governors.
9thly, That all pretensions to govern a community, so far distant from those who make these pretensions, that they cannot possibly secure to it those ends for which alone all just government is acknowledged to be instituted, are nugatory in their own nature.
10thly, That the people of America are too far distant from Great-Britain to obtain those ends by her exercising a legislative authority over them, and therefore cannot be subject to such an authority. 
11thly, That an union with America, by means of admitting an American representation in the British parliament, is the wildest of ail chimeras; as it was the basest of all insidious designs in a certain governor, to propose to administration a surprizal of them into this snare, be knowing and thinking they did not know, (vide his own Select Letters, p. 34, 40) that it would be subversive of their liberties.
12thly, That the superstitious notion of the uniform progress of empire westward only; and the absurd one, that Great-Britain must therefore one day become a province to America, are founded on superficial, empty, mistaken, and contradictory observations, utterly void of truth, with regard to the past, and equally destitute of probability, with respect to the future.
13thly, That if we would reap any lasting commercial advantages from, and preserve any durable power over, the American states, it must be by withdrawing not asserting our claims to parliamentary sovereignty;
thereby finally removing every cause of jealousy towards us, and proving that, with regard to them, Great-Britain is not a conquering, but a commercial state; not an oppressive ruler, but an equal trader; not a designer upon, but an undoubted protector os their rights and liberties against all invaders: bound to her by the ties of blood and mutual interests, by fincere love and friendship,
which abhors dependance; by the influences of one common language, law, and religion; by the same manners, fashions and habits, and by every other cementing principle which hath power to take hold of the human heart. 
14thly, That by making them independent of our will and pleasure, we (hall render them effectually dependent upon our Influence, and subservient to our interest and glory; this free country thus resembling its own kings, who always may, whenever they please, be more powerful, glorious, and happy, than the proudest of the monarchs who tyrannize over the rest of Europe.
I5thly, That it is in our power to bring into this kingdom, with their voluntary consent and agreement, every shilling the British Americans have in the world, beyond what is barely necessary for their own circulation; but that if, instead of equitable means, we will madly use no other than those of brutal force, they will speedily defy, impoverish and despise us.
16thly, That it is now, through our own rash councils and violent proceedings, too late to think of steering any middle course, of adopting measures for light
oppressions, �and being only moderately tyrannical; for that the Americans, from this day forward, must either be our independent, affectionate, and fast friends, or else the most deadly of our foes.
17thly and finally, That by means of a parliamentary declaration of their independency and a national league with them, we may, but by no other means can, effectually promote and secure, on a right basis, the mutual
prosperity of both countries.
   To this recapitulation let me only add a fervent prayer, that it may please God to endue the king and the lords of the council, the ministers of state, and all the nobility, the representatives of the people, and all in authority, with true wisdom and understanding, giving them grace to execute justice and to maintain truth; and that it may please him likewise to give unto all nations unity, peace, and concord to the end of time; but more especially to Great-Britain and British America, which have reason to esteem themselves, with pious gratitude, his peculiar people, since, through his especial savour, they
are so eminently exalted above all other nations, inasmuch as it hath pleased him, in his good Providence, to bless them with a free, a perfect constitution of government; a constitution which will improve with age, and never can know decay, so long as the people shall retain their virtue. 
P. S. The author, who wishes to attain as much self-knowledge as possible, would (without any irony) be much obliged to the Critical Reviewer of his pamphlet if he would take the trouble to prove to him what he really cannot believe on his mere ipse dixit, viz. that he is a declaimer, not a reasoner, provided the assertion be true; because he hopes he shall ever be open to conviction, and ready to accept of any one's assistance who will kindly lead him into the way of truth; an adherence to which he thinks is every man's interest. He feels a strong assurance within his own mind of being no declaimer, and though perhaps no acute reasoner, yet he thinks he is a just reasoner, or rather an appealer to reason; and he is inclined to esteem the practice of appealing as the best and most useful, because generally the most successful mode of reasoning.
