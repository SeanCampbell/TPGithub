The NORTH BRITON, 
Saturday, April 5, 1763.
The restless and turbulent disposition of the Scottish nation before the union, with their constant attachment to France and declared enmity to England, their repeated perfidies and rebellions since that period, with their servile behaviour.in times of .need, and overbearing insolence in power, have justly rendered the very name Scot hateful to every true Englishman. The mean arts by which the present minister acquired his power, and his conduct since the acquisition of it, the long and dark scenes of-dissimulation which he run through for the fake of greatness, with the open and insolent outrages he hath committed, since his accession to it, against men much better than himself, the little capacity which he hath shewn for business; the inglorious peace which he hath infamously patched up and whereby he hath sacrificed the glory and interest of this country to his own private ambition; his contempt of the English nobles, especially of those who are the known and tried friends of the constitution, and his strict union with those who are the avowed enemies of it; his mean and implacable resentments in turning out and reducing to poverty whole families, the honesty of whose patrons was their only crime; his gross partiality to his own beggarly countrymen ; his virulence against all who will not slavishly comply with his destructive measures; his associating with a man justly odious to every party, from whose influence this country hath every thing to fear, and who having been false to all, ought to be trusted by none; these things laid together have rendered the minister justly suspected by the people, and have is possible, made the name of Stuart more odious and contemptable than it was before.
The very great and excessive complaisance of the associates in power, if he will suffer them to be called associates, whom he never suffers to act as such, in embracing his pernicious doctrines, and falling in implicity with his fatal measures; their joining to give up in peace, what we had gained in war, their taking such steps as not only partially affect the property but strike deeply at the liberty of the subject, have weaned the affections of the people from those sew members in the administration in whom they had reposed some little confidence, and encreased their suspicions with regard to those whose former behaviour had not entitled them to any considence at all.
Under these circumstances, we cannot be surprised that the spirit of discord should go forth in the land, and the voice of opposition be strong in the streets; but what we cannot help admiring is the modesty and veracity of those tools of power who would persuade us that the body of the people are perfectly satisfied, and that all reports of public discontent are made and spread abroad by the venal emissaries of a disappointed faction. They do not scruple to assure us, that the earl of Bute is the darling of the nation, and as much approved in the quality of a minister, as his Royal master is beloved and reverenced as a king. They would represent to us those respectable personages, who oppose the minister, as influenced by envy, interest, and other selfish motives, and not at all actuated by a love of their king and country. Nay, they have ventured to proceed one step farther, and openly condemn all opposition on whatever principles it is taken up, as criminal in itself. A doctrine which we could scarce have expected to hear in England, (I hope it is not treason to make use of that word) at this time of day, or which we never could have imagined should have passed without rebuke. Not long since a divine of the church of England, remarkable only for reading lectures which no one went to hear, publicly maintained from the pulpit, that to resist the minister was to resist the king; to resist the king was to resist God, and that the consequence of such resistance must be damnation. Let me not, however, be thought to insinuate that this reverend adventurer in politics acted at all by the command of the one great man, however agreeable the doctrine might found in his ears. He certainly would never have employed this young
Saeheverel, when so many dignitaries were at his devotion, and all those grateful churchmen, who fled from the shipwreck, as they deemed it, of old Newcastle, must have stood ready at their idol's command, to preach up the traditions of men for the laws of God. But amongst all the advocates of despotism, the notorious Paul Whitehead is the most remarkable. Little could we have expected to have seen his name in the black list: What? He, who was ever a. licentious asserter of privileges, whose tongue was loudest in every mob to resound their rights, and vindicate the liberty of the press; who treated nobles with impunity, and trampled on the sacred honour of crowns, whose unbounded boldness brought him into such extremities, that he may relate, which he hath often-related, his ear-breath scapes, shall he become a defender of the base, infamous doctrine of passive obedience, and non-resistance shall he brand with the name of faction those men whom every honest Englishman considers as his dearest friends? Can he, who was enlisted under the banners of a staunch Republican, thus weakly change his opinion, and thus impudently declare it, merely because the dull patron is ridiculously renegadoed into a court Jacobites? Is this to be accounted for?
In spite, however, of all that can be said by private men, and threatened by those in a public station, can answer for myself, and hope I may for others, that the liberty of communicating our sentiments to  the public, freely and honestly; shall not be tamely given up, or, I trust, forced out of their hands. I am not yet so perfect in the court creed, as to believe they have any right to do it; and if they know their own interest, I am certain, they will not attempt it. The ridiculous figure which they made in the apprehension of those persons concerned in the Monitor hath opened their eyes, and tainted their rashness with some wholesome degree of fear. Inclination there is, no doubt, to silence the North Briton, but a consciousness of guilt prevents it's being carried into exertion and, however, they may deal out large promises, and thunder forth empty threats, that impudent libeller, as they are pleased to call, but cannot, or dare not prove him, shall still pursue the part in which he hath hitherto trod ; and whilst he finds the opposition, which is now gathering over the minister's head, composed of those men who are zealous for our constitution and lovers of their country, no means whatsoever shall be effectual to warp him from so greats so good, so necessary a cause. Whatsoever opinion slaves may entertain, they shall as soon persuade a free born Englishman to call the spirited opposition of the present earl of Bath, when Mr.Pulteney; the glorious efforts of those true patriots who expelled the cursed race of Stuart and the vigorous struggles of those barons to whom we owe Magna Charta, by a disgraceful name, as the animated advances which are now making against the influence of the proud Scot, under the conduct of men whose names shall descend to posterity, and stand in the roll of honour with the first patriots.
When the opposition to the minister is the subject of conversation, it is remarkable to observe how men who are in their hearts well-wishers to it, but have no spirit to speak out, retire back into themselves, how cautiously they hint their love of their country, as if it was a fault, and how sparingly they praise those who openly avow themselves the defenders of it. These men may love their country much, but they love themselves more. Public considerations have some share in their hearts, but no farther than as they fall in with their private views. � Self is their grand object, and their country comes in, only by the bye, and in a subordinate degree. They wish England well, but that is all � they will not advance one step, nor run the least risque to promote her welfare. Her situation may call for vigorous measures but they beg to be excused they chuse to wait � nor can come to any resolution, till the event shall give them an opportunity of joining the strongest party. Whatever consequence such fluctuating spirits may maintain in troubled times, sure I-am, that in a quiet and settled state, they ought to be treated with the utmost contempt. When a country is divided, neutrality is little better than treason; an honest man may through mistake, take the worst side; but he cannot be an honest man who refuses to take any. The timorous disposition of these lukewarm patriots is at present inexcusable, as the opposition to Scottish influence is founded on those principles which ought to make every Englishman a party in it, and conducted by those men, whom long and repeated services have taught us to honour. Whatever face the credit of the minister might wear sometime since, and however his slaves might boast the strength of their chains, observation may convince us, that his power is now in vain, and that a storm is gathering over him which must involve him in disgrace. However the name of England may be lost, the spirit still remains; nor would the North Briton for a moment believe, even at that time when there was more ground to believe it than he could have wished, that an upstart Scot should lord it uncontrouled over such a nation as this; or that the Whigs, those old and true friends of king and people, should tamely sit
down, and suffer the hellish designs of Tories to be carried into execution without resistance.
The minister himself seems conscious of his decline, his fears appear in spite of his pride, he is meanly endeavouririg to break the force of the opposition by disuniting the members of it; and employs his paltry emissaries for that purpose. But should he unhappily succeed in that attempt, it cannot establish his power, though it may prolong it; the English are a people who will not suffer their rights to be trampled on for any length of time, and whose just resentments have ever been successful against favourites and aliens. They will no more suffer the person who hath injured and oppressed them to skulk out of power without calling him to account, than they will tamely bear his oppressions whilst in authority. A minister is the servant of the public, and accountable to them. Our constitution is so happily tempered that it is not in the power of a sovereign to secure a bad minister, and this we may be certain that it can never be the inclination of the best of sovereigns to protect the worst ministers. The Earl of Strafford is an example on record, which our great man would do well to consider, and tremble. How soon this desired change may be brought to bear, we cannot pretend, though blest with the gift of second sight, to ascertain ; this, however, we may venture to declare, that it cannot be far distant The jarring principles of those who compose the administration, and the impossibility of their blending with each other, so as to give and receive strength at the same time, made it probable from the first, that their union could not be of long continuance, and the noble spirit which hath been of late exerted against the minister by those honest men, who love both king and country, gives us a pleasing prospect of being speedily restored to harmony amongst ourselves. Nothing is necessary but resolution and perseverance, and these I am convinced cannot be wanting, when I consider the persons, from whom we expect our deliverance.
As it maybe convenient to many persons on various accounts to give as near a guess as possible, when this ministerial revolution will take place, I shall give them a hint which may perhaps assist their conjectures, and propose Mr. Fox as a mark of observation to all who trade in politics. His steadiness to his own interest, with his remarkable talents of penetration, have hitherto enabled, and I doubt not will still induce him to quit his post when he can keep it no longer, and to leave his friends in the lurch. When we see him, therefore, flying from the storm, pleading age and sickness, accepting of a peerage, or retiring to the government of the alley, we may safely conclude that a change is at hand, and that concord shall once more take place among.us.

March 26, 1763.
I AM not surprized at the general alarm, which has spread not only through the capital, but likewise through the whole kingdom, from a well grounded terror of the fatal consequences so justly to be apprehended from the-new tax on cyder. This odious and partial tax is likewise to be enforced in the most odious and partial manner possible, by an extention of the laws of excise. The very word is hateful to an English ear, and the new doctrines introduced by that most grievous system of laws have, in a good measure, repealed the most favourable law of our constitution, which has ever been considered as the birth-right of an Englishman, and the sacred palladium of liberty; I mean the tryal by Jury. In every case of property, where the excise is interested, the decision is not by a Jury, where the party has a right to object to any one or more of twelve partial or prejudicial men, but in one or two justices, or commissioners, who may have private, selfish views, and from whom generally there is no appeal. By the mode of the tax on cyder, not only professed dealers in the commodity, but many new orders of men become subject to the laws of excise; and an insolent exciseman, under the influence, perhaps by the order of an insolent minister, may force his way into the house of any private gentleman, or farmer or freeholder, who has been guilty of voting contrary to a ministerial mandate, and of obliging a friend with part of the growth of his own orchard. Even for what is used in his own family, a poll-tax of five shillings per head is to be paid, by all persons of the family not under nine years of age. I am glad the limitation, is confined, by this merciful and forbearing ministry, to that tender age, because I think, master (I beg. his pardon captain) Elliot, at ten years of age, with a commission in his pocket, ought to pay himself, or, at least, be paid for by his Papa, (I beg pardon again, I mean his father) Mr. Gilbert Elliot, out of the half-pay which he receives, in these days of �conomy, for the eminent services performed to the public by the little master. I am satisfied even that proud Scot, who has here learnt to talk such very courtly language, would not utter one word against the actual payment of a fair share of such a tax, imposed by the advice and influence of his countryman, chiefly on a few rich English counties. I am sure he ought to rest satisfied with his good fortune, for he has the treasury of the chamber in England, which is a present income of near 3,000 per annum, and the reversion of a most useless office, keeper of the signet in Scotland, a place for life, of 1,700 per annum, for himself, and his deputy (I suppose the said infant captain) receives 300 per annum more, I do not mean Scotch but English pounds.
The partiality of the tax on cyder has been no less blamed than the odious mode of collecting it; but the most cogent objection with the disinterested part of mankind goes still deeper; for the enormous profit made by the subscribers to the new loan proves, that the tax was so far unnecessary. The proprietors, who have been gratified with it, exult at so immense and so secure a plunder of the nation, while the candid and unbiassed part of mankind stand astonished at the effrontery of the minister through this whole transaction. The bargan is the most scandalous ever made for the public. It has been attempted to be excused from the uncertainty of the negociations with France and the difficulties which arose between two the courts, even after the Preliminaries were signed. Mr. Fox himself fully answered this; for in a great assembly, he affirmed, that the bargan was made on the eighteenth of February, and that it was known here before that time, that the Definitive Treaty was actually signed on the tenth. In a very small assembly he asserted, that a bargan still more infamously injurious, to the public had been concluded by the minister on that very day, the eighteenth, and as infamously on his part receded from, on the twentieth; and finally on the present scandalous terms, on the twenty-second. What must the terms of the eighteenth have been, that even such a minister was not only ashamed, but afraid to keep? I am sure, I may safely assert this little anecdote, as coining from Mr. Fox himself, and this without the least suspicion of new-invented new found-land Forgery. The Bashaw has the obligation to his real friend and (in Scollipi- phrase) his deer, Mr. Fox, of the public detection of the infamous scene, This bargan was not laid before parliament till the seventh of March. It would have been very extraordinary in any other hoard of treasury to have concluded the bargan so long before, because it neither can nor ought to be considered in any other light, than as a bargan made at the very time of the application to parliament. Infinite imposition and abuse might otherwise follow. The settled method has been to develope the whole business, and to compare the proposal of the day with the general price of stocks at that time. All former chancellors of the Exchequer who have not been ashamed to know something of their business  have invariably pursued this rule. The navy, victualling, and transport services, on the seventh of February (three days before the Definitive Treaty was signed) were charged on the sinking fund, at four per cent, more advantagous than the allowance to the former creditors of the public: for a profit of two per cent, is given to every subscriber on account of prompt payment, who chuses to make it. This gives a profit of one and a half on every 100 of the four per cent, redeemable, and in effect it actually fells at little less than 103 without any materials change of circumstance.
I think it is now made clear to demonstration that the prime minister ought not to have given above a bare four per cent, redeemable for the 3,500,000 lent to the public. The profit infallibly to be made on the lottery tickets could not in estimation fall much short of 9 for the two tickets, given with every 100 Government, till it tell into the hands of the present most incapable minister, has ever availed itself of this profit, in favour of the public, and credit has ever been taken for it in the bargan made with the subscribers. The unexampled paucity of the tickets, no more than 35,000 in each lottery, and the great probability that this kind of gaming will end with this auspicious year (till the rottenness of the Peace brings us into new difficulties, perhaps, speedily to end in a new war) advanced the price of them so high, that their present rise cannot surprise any man, whose attention has been turned to matters of this nature, founded on comparative experience. It cannot therefore be deemed an accidental or problematical rise, but was certain and inevitable.
The mismanagement of the finances of this kingdom must give the deepest concern to every thinking man, who really loves his country. Such a man cannot but ask the question, whether the late infamous job was the consequence of incapacity or villainy, or a mixture of both? Let it be either, it has ended in a manner equally fatal to the public, thus defrauded of so large a sum The finking fund, which has had the epithet of sacred peculiarly applied to it, is so wantonly clogged, and groans under so many anticipations, that, it is confessed, it will not produce any thing to the public for above seven years. This prospect into futurity is still more clouded by the declarations made very publicly, by those who have the power to carry them into execution, that another tax, probably on the odious line of excise is in the next year at least to be laid upon the public in addition to the land-tax still to be continued at four shillings in the pound. This declaration exactly tallies with every other act of that low cunning which characterises the minister, for it holds out to his creatures the blessed second sight of more plunder of the nation, if the hounds continue to follow their former seeder. Thus is the minister as well as these robbers of the public driven to the commission of a second crime, to secure impunity of the
First.
This first essay of the Scot in the business of our treasury is, indeed, by the hand of a master; but of what kind? surely of a most corrupt and profuse master who must be totally ignorant of our finances, or at least very lately have acquired any practical knowledge of money mailers, unless in the receipt of a small annual pension, obtained with difficulty from the duke of Newcastle for his faithful services, and steady vote in a former parliament. In either case, he ought not, at so critical a moment, boldly to have assumed the sole administration of so important a department, where his own incapacity, and his chancellor�s ignorance, are the hourly ridicule even of the youngest, most dependant clerk in the treasury. The tax on cyder has for many days covered them both with public contempt and derision. If it receives the sanction of the legislature, according to the mode of excise proposed, or rather imposed by the Minion, I will venture to assert, that he will soon be deservedly as unpopular and as much detested in every county in England, as Mr. Bomber Gascoyne is very undeservedly in Lancashire. His gentle and gentlemanlike manners, his candour, urbanity and sweetness of temper, his politeness and high breeding, soar even beyond his patron's, and ought to conciliate mankind to the minister as well as to himself. I hope too they will for ever obliterate the odious name of Butcher Gascone, by which all his cotemporaries at Oxford, in so uncourtly a way, still persist to mark him.
The whole progress of the tax on cyder has shewn to mankind that nothing could have equalled the impudent pretence the minister has made to superior ability and �conomy, but his ignorance, fraud, and prosusion, to a degree scarcely to be credited, but on the notorious evidence of facts. I chuse to argue from facts, because my Lord-Mayor is so fond of travelling the high priori road. That acute reasoner and sound scholar has more than once assured us, that he always will argue a priori, from fails, a priori. I say, Why do gentlemen laugh? I argue from the stubborn evidence of facts, Sir. Arguments drawn from facts, a priori, Sir. cannot be resisted. That gravels gentlemen. I see they feel me, etc., etc.
I shall conclude my ideas of the Scottish administration of our finances with an old observation of Swift. I could point out some Scots with great titles, whose whole revenues before the Union would have ill maintained a Welch justice of the peace, and have since gathered more money than ever any Scotchman, who had not travelled, could form an idea of.
March 19, 1765.
THERE is generally one favourite, ministerial word in high vogue. The minister himself first broaches it, and afterwards the whole herd of his dependents is ordered to eccho it through the nation. During the administration of Mr. Pelham, the fashionable word was candour. He frequently made use of it, and he really loved the thing more than the word. His whole public conduct gave the most convincing proofs of his candour. The cant word of the present minister is �conomy. There is not a poor, insignificant, English Tory, or Scottish Jacobite clerk, who has been three days in the customs, or excise, but has already learnt his lesson, and talks incessantly of the new ministers �conomy. We hear of nothing but �conomy, though we cannot, in any one business of national concern, discern the least trace of it. It is become the Shibboleth of the whole Scottish faction; for their countryman is forever retailing the word to us, even when he is practising the most unbounded prodigality. The word he never forgets: the application of it to any public business we have never yet experienced from him. At no period of the English history has the nation been so much amused with words, and so grosly abused with glaring facts of extortion on the people, as of late by the present Scottish minister. It is an old observation, that he that first cries out stop thief, is often he that has stolen the treasure. We have heard of nothing but �conomy, and we have seen nothing but profusion and extravagance. The proof shall soon follow the assertion; but I shall first state a late very extraordinary occurrence.
By the Votes of the house of Commons, we find, that on the seventh of March, an address was voted to his majesty, though not without opposition, that he would be graciously pleased to employ in the army such persons, as now art, or shall he, upon half-pay, who are qualified to serve his majesty. This surely was so plain and self evident an instance of �conomy to the public, as well as justice to the officer, that such an address must in its very nature be trifling, or must mean a direct insult on the minister. I think indeed, that it sheweth the suspicion which that honourable house entertained with regard to his real intention. The house knew their gracious sovereign had the wise regulations of a just �conomy at heart: but they seemed greatly to have distrusted the ministry, and therefore proceeded in a true constitutional manner, by recommending.the measure in a dutiful and humble address to the crown. I only argue from the Votes which l suppose are printed, that the public may fairly reason on all parliamentary proceedings, of such a kind as ere judged fit to be submitted to the opinion of Mankind. At the opening of the session, in a most gracious speech from the throne his majesty strenuously advised his parliament to lay the foundation of that �conomy, which we owe to ourselves and to our posterity, and which can alone relieve this nation from the heavy burthens brought upon it by the necessities of this long and expensive war. In the answer likewise to this address, his majesty has graciously pleased to declare. It is therefore clear that our most excellent sovereign had always at heart the scheme of oeconony, and the minister, was believed by parliament to be averse to it. This unravels the mystery of this address, and proves that it, not only became the wisdom of parliament, but was peculiarly adapted to the critical circumstances of the times. The conduct of the minister has shewn the justice of this opinion. The first principles of national �conomy have been disregarded, for every regiment has been compleated as to its compliment of officers even a few days only before it hath been broke, and chiefly by Scotchmen. This has most infamously swelled the half pay list, and put the nation to an enormous expence, without a pretence of the least service to the public. I beg to know how many weeks Mr. Gilbert Elliot's son has had a captain's commission, and if he is yet ten years old? The list of the army has been entirely printed off; but was ordered to be suppressed, and the new secretary at war, the jackall of the paymaster, bought the whole impressions. This has kept from the eye of the public this in famous scene, as well as the names of the several Scots, who distinguished themselves under the banners of rebellion in 1745, and have been promoted since the administration of their countrymen. Their names however shall in due time be given to the public, and their loyal deeds faithfully recorded. By such methods has the half pay list grown to its present enormous size, and so deep a wound been given to the public, even in �conomy.
Let us now consider another striking instance of the total disregard of �conomy: I mean the present loan of 3,500,000. The terms of the new subscription have been so injurious to the public, but so beneficial to the subscribers, that is, to the creatures of the minister, that there was immediately an advance of seven per cent, and in a very few days of above eleven per cent. I shall however, only state it at the even, round sum, of ten per cent, that I may not puzzle the chancellor of the Exchequer. The whole loan amounted to 3,500,000 consequently in the period of a very few days, the minister gave among his creatures, and the tools of his power, 350,000 which was levied on the public: the most enumerous sum ever divided in so short a time among any set of men. A few of their names I will
mention to show in what estimation they are held by the public: Messieurs Touchet, Glover, Cust, (brother to the able and impartial speaker) Amyand Maygens, Salvador, Colebrooke, Thornton and Muilman, had each 200,000 of the new subscription, and of course almost immediately cleared 20,000 each, which they have, or have not, shared among their friends. In this instance, however, I dare say. the public will experience no stoppage of payment: such bargans are more likely to bring a nation, than the proprietors themselves, to bankruptcy. In a lucrative, ministerial job of any kind it was impossible the name of Mr. Fox could be omitted, He had 100,000 that is 10,000 clear profit. What the jackall had, I know not; but Mr. Calcraft, not in Mr. Foxs name, had upwards of 70,000, that is a gift of 7,000.  Mr. Drummond, a Scottish banker, to whom his countryman, while his shop continued open, had such obligations in 1745, was gratified with 70,000 or in other words, had 7,000 given him. I hope that this douceur is really meant for Mr. Drummond and not for the ministers poor distressed cousin, and name-
sake, at Rome. The governor of the bank Robert Marsh, Esq; had 150,000 to keep the gentlemen there in good humour, and to preserve his own good humour 50,000. Lewis Way, Esq; sub-governor of the South-Sea, had the same sum, for the same purpose. Such douceurs were given to such persons, when gentlemen of the first monied property in the kingdom, who had subscribed the largest sums in all the exigences of government, during the two last wars, and who were of known affection to the Brunswick line, were refused any share. The reason given to several, was, you are no friends of the minister. The minister has declared that he had actually had a tender of above seventeen millions only from the city. The public will judge from chis how impossible it was to carry on the war even another year.
This enormous sum of 350,000 ought to have been saved to the public. It undoubtedly might have been, if a fair bargan had been made by honest and intelligent stewards of the public, free from any disposition, or at least any resolution, to buy friends in so shameful a way with the nation's money. The sum is very near one shilling in the pound of the land-tax, which the zealous, fond, believing, obsequious, confiding, supporting, acquiescing, bearing and forbearing country gentlemen ought, among their stipulations with the minister, to have saved the nation. The public would then have had one obligation to their ministerial zeal, and some amends made for their scandalous prostitution. Had there been the least attention to �conomy, we see this saving might have been made. If the shilling in the pound had not been taken off the land, the odious tax on cyder, in its present oppressive mode, would have been totally unnecessary: but the excise laws seem to be the favourite laws of the new minister, and his chancellor of the Exchequer declared with a perspicuity, of which only that one head was capable, that he was not for an Extension of the excise laws, but for an Enlargement of them. If their can be any meaning couched in such barbarism, it should seem that the hydra of Excise is now to reach, where its cruel fangs never did before. After the monster of Excise had been long kept tame, this chancellor of the Exchequer, I should imagine, is ordered to enlarge his laws, and then another is to come to extend his accursed dominion through the land. Yet (not to deviate from his happy Patavaniss) all the whole total is any thing for peace and quietness Jake; and at this time we must be content to
take the thing rough as it runs.
I desire likewise to state the case of the lotteries, and of the gross impositions on the public, by that
part of the late bargan. Lotteries have always been objected to as promoting the spirit of gaming, so peculiarly pernicious to a commercial country. The necessities of government, during the two late wars, forced this measure: I mean of a lottery, but this year, the year of peace, we are to have two lotteries. To make this scheme as chargeable as possible to the public, and creative of more jobs, as well as longer to keep up the spirit of gaming, the two lotteries are to be drawn at two different times of the year. A minister who had really any love of �conomy, would have made the tickets duplicates of each other, and have saved one half of the expence to the public. The Earl of Bute chuses to parade about �conomy, at the very time he is practising the most unjustifiable profusion. In former years the interest on the lottery annuites commenced a year after the bringing in the scheme, and was only three per cent. In this frugal Scottish administration, it commences almost with the first payment and is four per cent. I must observe how very unnecessarily, and even wantonly, this was done; for experience convinces us how little attention is paid by the purchasers of lottery tickets to the rate of interest ,
accruing on them. 
The creditors of the public for navy, transport-victualling, and ordnance services, have at least as much merit with the nation, (whom they trusted without the security of a fund, in dangerous times) and as strict a right to justice, as the new creditors of this loan advanced in days of peace. To the former the minister has thought it just to give a bare four per cent redeemable at pleasure, to commence from the next Lady-day. To the meritorious subscribers to the loan, interest commences upon the whole from the first payment, together with two lottery tickets for every 100 which are now selling at the advanced price of 9 clear gain. I wish to know by what scale of equity, the merit of these two sets of the public creditors have been weighed. Is it in the same Scottish ballance, by which evacuation only was to be the lot of one ally, and restitution of all the rest? How exactly parallelled to our foreign honour is our domestic justice!
An open subscription has ever been deemed the fairest and most economical method of borrowing money for the public. In times of war, and public distress, government for greater security has been obliged to have recourse to the other, more confined mode, though subject to partiality, job, and influence. In these days of peace and affluence, is there a man who doubts that an open subscription would have been filled as soon as made public even with an overflowing of millions? but in this case , the hungry harpies of the minister had not feasted on the vitals of their country.
In former subscriptions even during a war, and a certainty of it's continuance, an English first commissioner of the Treasury has always thought about one percent, a sufficient profit, when so large, a sum as twelve millions has been raised on the public. His friends always rested satisfied with that expectation. Under the Scotsman a set of hungry, avaritious, rapacious dependants have, with certainty of a peace, and the sum of three millions and a half only to be raised, made above eleven per cent, of the public. I speak of those who have already, fold other things, besides their subscriptions. 
For the future, whenever I hear of Scottish �conomy, I shall conclude, that in private and house-hold concerns, it means forbidness, in public matters profusion corruption and extravagance.
In this manner is the nation insulted by the falsest pretences to �conomy, and her wealth squandered
among the tools of an insolent, all-grasping minister.
Gracious and best of Princes, knowest thou thus!
