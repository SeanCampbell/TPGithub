THE mystery is at last unravelled. I shall no more wonder now that you engross his company at Purley, whilst his other friends can scarce get a sight of him. This, you say, was President Bradshaw's seat. That is the secret of his attachment to the place. You hold him by the best security, his political prejudices and enthusiasm. But do not let his veneration for the memory of the ancient possessor pass upon you for affection to the present. 
Should you be altogether so severe upon my politics; when you reflect that, merely for attempting to prevent the effusion of brother's blood and the final dismemberment of the empire, I stand the single legal victim during the contest, and the single instance of proscription after it? But I am well contented that my principles, which have made so many of your way of thinking angry, should only make you laugh. Such however as they are, they need not now to be defended by me: for they have stood the test of ages; and they will keep their ground in the general commendation of the world, till men forget to love themselves; though, till then perhaps, they are not likely to be seen (nor credited if seen) in the practice of many individuals. 
But are you really forced to go above a hundred years back to account for my attachment to Purley? Without considering the many strong public and private ties by which I am bound to its present possessor, can you find nothing in the beautiful prospect from these windows? nothing in the entertainment every one receives in this house? nothing in the delightful rides and walks we have taken round it? nothing in the cheerful disposition and easy kindness of its owner, to make a rational man partial to this habitation? 
T. � Sir, you are making him transgress our only standing rules. Politics and compliments are strangers here. We always put them off when we put on our boots; and leave them behind us in their proper atmosphere, the smoke of London. 
B. � Is it possible! Can either of you � Englishmen and patriots! � abstain for four-and-twenty hours together from politics! You cannot be always on horseback, or at piquet. What, in the name of wonder, your favourite topic excluded, can be the subject of your so frequent conversations? 
T, � You have a strange notion of us. But I assure you we find more difficulty to finish than to begin our conversations. As for our subjects, their variety cannot be remembered; but I will tell you on what we were discoursing yesterday when you came in; and I believe you are the fittest person in the world to decide between us. He insists, contrary to my opinion, that all sorts of wisdom and useful knowledge may be obtained by a plain man of sense without what is commonly called Learning. And when I took the easiest instance, as I thought, and the foundation of all other knowledge, (because it is the beginning of education, and that in which children are first employed,) he declined the proof of his assertion in this instance, and maintained that I had chosen the most difficult: for he says that, though Grammar be usually amongst the first things taught, it is always one of the last understood. 
B. � I must confess I differ from Mr. H. concerning the difficulty of Grammar; if indeed what you have reported be really his opinion. But might he not possibly give you that answer to escape the discussion of a disagreeable dry subject, remote from the course of his studies and the objects of his inquiry and pursuit? By his general expression of � what is commonly called Learning � and his declared opinion of that, I can pretty well guess what lie thinks of grammatical learning in particular. I dare swear (though he will not perhaps pay me so indifferent a compliment) he does not in his mind allow us even the poor consolation which we find in Athenseus, � but concludes, without a single exce]ation, ovSev. 
I must however intreat him to recollect, (and at the same time whose authority it bears,) that � "Qui sapientise et literarum divortium faciunt, nunquam ad solidam sapientiam pertingent. Qui vero alios etiam a literarum linguarumque studio absterrent, iion antiquee sapientise sed novse stultitiae doctores sunt habendi." 
H. � Indeed I spoke my real sentiments. I think Grammar difficult, but I am very far from looking upon it as foolish: indeed so far, that I consider it as absolutely necessary in the search after philosophical truth; which, if not the most useful perhaps, is at least the most pleasing employment of the human mind. And I think it no less necessary in the most important questions concerning religion and civil society. But since you say it is easy, tell me where it may be learned. 
B. � If your look and the tone of your voice were less serious, the extravagance of your compliment to grammar would incline me to suspect that you were taking your revenge, and bantering me in your turn by an ironical encomium on my favourite study. But, if I am to suppose you in earnest, I answer, that our English grammar may be sufficiently and easily learned from the excellent Introduction of Doctor Lowth: or from the Vii (as well as the best) English grammar, given by Ben Jonson. 
H. � True, Sir. And that was my first slight answer to our friend's instance. But his inquiry is of a much larger compass than you at present seem to imagine. He asks after the causes or reasons of Grammar": and for satisfaction in them I know not where to send him; for, I assure you, he has a troublesome, inquisitive, scrupulous mind of his own, that will not take mere words in current payment. 
-B. � I should think that difficulty easily removed. Dr. Lowth, in his Preface, has done it ready to your hands. "Those," he says, " who would enter more deeply into this subject, will find it fully and accurately handled with the greatest acuteness of investigation, perspicuity of explication, and elegance of method, in a treatise intitled Hermes, by James Harris, esq. the most beautiful and perfect example of Analysis that has been exhibited since the days of Aristotle." 
T. � The recommendation no doubt is full, and the authority great; but I cannot say that I have found the performance to correspond: nor can I boast of any acquisition from its perusal, except indeed of hard words and frivolous or unintelligible distinctions. And I have learned from a most excellent authority, that "tout ce qui varie, tout ce qui se charge de termes douteux et envelopes, a toujours paru suspect; et non seulement frauduleux, mais encore absolument faux: parcequ'il marque un embarras que la verite ne connoit point'." 
B. � And you, Sir? 
?. � I am really in the same situation. 
B. � Have you tried any other of our English authors on the subject? 
H. � I believe all of them, for they are not numerous"; but none with satisfaction. 
The reader of Caramuel (who, together with Campanella, may be found in the Bodleian Library) will not be cHsappointed in him; but most egregiously by him, if the smallest expectations of information are excited by the character which is here given of Scotus � whose De Modis Significandi should be intitled, not Grammutica Speculativa, but � 
?. � You must then give up one at least of your positions. For if, as you make it out, Grammar is so difficult that a knowledge of it cannot be obtained by a man of sense from any authors in his own language, you must send him to what is commonly called Learning, to the Greek and Latin authors, for the attainment of it. So true, in this science at least, if not in all others, is that saying of Roger Ascham, that � "Even as a hawke fleeth not hie with one wing, even so a man reacheth not to excellency with one tongue." 
H. � On the contrary, I am rather confirmed by this instance in my first position. I acknowledge philosophical Grammar Exemplar of the subtle art of saving appearances, and of discoursing deeply and learnedly on a subject with which we are totally unacquainted. Quid enim subt'ilms vel mugis temce, qiimn quod nihil est?
The great Bacon put this subject amongst his Desiderata, not, as Wilkins says, because "few had treated of it;" but because no one had given a satisfactory account of it. At the same time. Bacon, though evidently wide of the mark himself, yet conjectured best how this knowledge might most probably be attained; and pointed out the most proper materials for reflection to work upon, to which only my suspected compliment was intended) to be a most necessary step towards wisdom and true knowledge. 
From the innumerable and inveterate mistakes which have been made concerning it by the wisest philosophers and most diligent inquirers of all ages, and from the thick darkness in which they have hitherto left it, I imagine it to be one of the most difficult speculations. Yet, I suppose, a man of plain common sense may obtain it, if he will dig for it; but I cannot think that what is commonly called Learning, is the mine in which it will be found. Truth, in my opinion, has been improperly imagined at the bottom of a well: it lies much nearer to the surface: though buried indeed at present under mountains of learned rubbish; in which there is nothing to admire but the amazing strength of those vast giants of literature who have been able thus to heap Pelion upon Ossa. This at present is only my opinion, which perhaps I have entertained too lightly. Since therefore the question has been started, I am pleased at this occasion of being confirmed or corrected by you; whose application, opportunities, extensive reading, acknowledged abilities, and universal learning, enable you to inform us of all that the ancients have left or the moderns have written on the subject. 
B. � Oh! Sir, your humble servant! compliments, I perceive, are banished from Purley. But I shall not be at all inticed by them to take upon my shoulders a burthen which you seem desirous to shift off upon me. Besides, Sir, with all your caution, you have said too much now to expect it from me. It is too late to recall what has passed your lips: and if Mr. T. is of my sentiments, you shall not be permitted to explain yourself away. The satisfaction which he seeks after, you say is to be had; and you tell us the mine where you think it is not to be found. Now I shall not easily be persuaded that you are so rash, and take up your opinions so lightly, as to advance or even to imagine this; unless you had first searched that mine yourself, and formed a conjecture at least concerning the place where you suppose this knowledge is to be found. Instead therefore of making the display to Mr. T. my reading, which you have already declared insufficient for the purpose, is it not much more reasonable that you should communicate to us the result of your reflection? 
?. With all my heart, if you chuse it should be so, and think you shall have patience to hear me through. I own I prefer instruction to correction, and had rather have been informed without the hazard of exposing myself; but if you make the one a condition of the other, I think it still worth my acceptance; and will not lose this opportunity of your judgment for a little shame. I acknowledge then that the subject is not intirely new to my thoughts: for, though languages themselves may be and usually are acquired without any regard to their principles; I very early found it, or thought I found it, impossible to make many steps in the search after truth and the nature of human understanding, of good and evil, of right and wrong, without well considering the nature of language, which appeared to me to be inseparably connected with them. I own therefore I long since formed to myself a kind of system, which seemed to me of singular use in the very small extent of my younger studies to keep my mind from confusion and the imposition of words. After too long an interval of idleness and pleasure, it was my chance to have occasion to apply to some of the modern languages; and, not being acquainted with any other more satisfactory, I tried my system with these, and tried it with success. I afterwards found it equally useful to me with some of the dead languages. Whilst I was thus amusing myself, the political struggle commenced; for my share in which you so far justly banter me, as I do acknowledge that, both in the outset and the progress of it, ? was guilty of two most egregious blunders; by attributing a much greater portion of virtue to individuals, and of understanding to the generality, than any experience of mankind can justify. After another interval therefore (not of idleness and pleasure) ? was again called by the questions of our friend Mr. T. (for yesterday is not the first time by many that he has mentioned it) to the consideration of this subject. I have hitherto declined attempting to give him the satisfaction he required: for, though the notion I had of language had satisfied my own mind and answered my own purposes, I could not venture to detail to him my crude conceptions without having ever made the least inquiry into the opinions of others. Besides, I did not at all 
suspect that my notions, if just, could be peculiar to myself: and I hoped to find some author who might give him a clearer, fuller, and more methodical account than I could, free from those errors and omissions to which I must be liable. Having therefore some small intervals of leisure, and a great desire to give him the best information; I confess I have employed some part of that leisure in reading every thing I could easily and readily procure that has been suggested by others. 
� I am afraid I have already spoken with too much presumption: But when I tell you that I differ from all those who with such infinite labour and erudition have gone before me on this subject; what apology -
B. � Oh! make none. When men think modestly, they may be allowed to speak freely. Come � Where will you begin? � Alpha � Go on. 
H. � Not with the organical part of language, I assure you. For, though in many respects it has been and is to this moment grossly mistaken, (and the mistakes might, with the help of some of the first principles of natural philosophy and anatomy, be easily corrected,) yet it is an inquiry more of curiosity than immediate usefulness, 
B. � You will begin then either with things or ideas: for it is impossible we should ever thoroughly understand the nature of the signs, unless we first properly consider and arrange the things signified. Whose system of philosophy will you build upon? 
H. � What you say is true. And yet I shall not begin there. Hermes, you know, put out the eyes of Argus: and I suspect that he has likewise blinded philosophy: and if I had not imagined so, I should never have cast away a thought upon this subject. If therefore Philosophy herself has been misled by Language, how shall she teach us to detect his tricks? 
B. � Begin then as you please. Only begin. 
OF THE DIVISION OR DISTRIBUTION OF I.ANGUAGE
H. � The purpose of Language is to communicate our thoughts 
B. � You do not mention this, I hope, as something new, or wherein you differ from others? 
H. � You are too hasty with me. No. But I mention it as that principle, which, being kept single in contemplation, has misled all those who have reasoned on this subject. 
B. � Is it not true, then? 
?. � I think it is. And that on which the whole matter rests. 
B. � And yet the confining themselves to this true principle, upon which the whole matter rests, has misled them! 
H. � Indeed I think so. 
B. � This is curious! 
H. � Yet I hope to convince you of it. For thus they reasoned Words are the signs of things. There must therefore be as many sorts of words, or parts of speech, as there are sorts of things. The earliest inquirers into language proceeded then to settle how many sorts there were of things; and from thence how many sorts of words, or parts of speech. Whilst this method of search strictly prevailed, the parts of speech were very few in number: but two. At most three, or four. 
All things, said they, must have names. But there are two sorts of things: 
1 . Res que permanent. 
2, Res quafuunt. 
There must therefore be two sorts of words or parts of speech: viz. 
1. Note rerum qua: permanent. 
2. Not rerum quccfluunt. 
Well; but surely there are words which are neither nota rerum permanentium, nor yet nota rerum fuentium. What will you do with them? � We cannot tell: we can find but these two sorts in rerum natura: call therefore those other words, if you will, for the present, particles'^, or inferior parts of speech, till we can find out what they are. Or, as we see they are constantly interspersed between nouns and verbs, and seem therefore in a manner to hold our speech together, suppose you call them conjunctions or connectives. This seems to have been the utmost progress that philosophical Grammar had made till about the time of Aristotle, when a fourth part of speech was added, � the definitive, or article. From this moment Grammar quits the day-light; and plunges into an abyss of utter darkness. 
- A good convenient name for all the words which we do not understand; for, as the denomination means nothing in particular, and contains no description, it will equally suit any short word we may please to refer thither. There has latterly been much dispute amongst Grammarians concerning the use of this word, particle, in the division and distribution of speech: particularly by Ghard, Dangeau, the authors of the Encyclopedie, &c. In which it is singular that they should all be right in their arguments against the use made of it by others; and all wrong m the use which each of them would make of it himself. Dr. S. Johnson adopts N. Bailey's definition of a particle � "a word unvaried by inflection." And Locke defines particles to be � "the words whereby the mind signifies what connection it gives to the several affirmations and negations that it unites in one continued reasoning or narration." 
3. The Latin Grammarians amuse themselves with debating 
Convinctio or Conjunctio. The Danes and the Dutch seem to have taken different sides of the question: for the Danish language terms it Bindeord, and the Dutch Koppehuoord. Here concluded the search after the different sorts of words, or parts of speech, from the difference of things: for none other apparently rational, acknowledged, or accepted difference has been suggested. 
According to this system, it was necessary that all sorts of words should belong to one of these four classes. For words being the signs of things, their sorts must necessarily follow the sorts of the things signified. And there being no more than four differences of things, there could be but four parts of speech. The difficulty and controversy now was, to determine to which of these four classes each word belonged. In the attempting of which, succeeding Grammarians could neither satisfy themselves nor others: for they soon discovered some words so stubborn, that no sophistry nor violence could by any means reduce them to any one of these classes. However, by this attempt and dispute they became better acquainted with the differences of words, though they could not account for them; and they found the old system deficient, though they knew not how to supply its defects. They seem therefore to have reversed the method of proceeding from things to signs, pursued by the philosophers; and, still allowing the principle, (viz. that there must be as many sorts of words as of things,) they travelled backwards, and sought for the things from the signs: adopting the converse of the principle; namely, that there must be as many differences of things as of signs. Misled therefore by the useful contrivances of language, they supposed many imaginary differences of things: and thus added greatly to the number of parts of speech, and in consequence to the errors of philosophy. 
Add to this, that the greater and more laborious part of Grammarians (to whose genius it is always more obvious to remark a multitude of effects than to trace out one cause) confined themselves merely to notice the differences observable in words, without any regard to the things signified. 
From this time the number of parts of speech has been variously reckoned: you will find different Grammarians contending for more than thirty. But most of those who admitted the fewest, acknowledged eight. This was long a favourite number; and has been kept to by many who yet did not include the same parts to make up that number. For those who rejected the article reckoned eight: and those who did not allow the interjection still reckoned eight. But what sort of difference in words should intitle them to hold a separate rank by themselves, has not to this moment been settled. 
B. � You seem to forget, that it is some time since words have been no longer allowed to be the signs of things. Modem Grammarians acknowledge them to be (as indeed Aristotle called them, ??????? ?????????) the signs or ideas: at the same time denying the other assertion of Aristotle, that ideas are the likenesses of things\ And this has made a great alteration in the manner of accounting for the differences of words. 
H. � That has not much mended the matter. No doubt this alteration approached so far nearer to the truth; but the nature of Language has not been much better understood by it. For Grammarians have since pursued just the same method with mind, as had before been done with things. The different operations of the mind are to account now for what the different things were to account before: and when they are not found sufficiently numerous for the purpose, it is only supposing an imaginary operation or two, and the difficulties are for the time shuffled over. So that the very same game has been played over again with ideas, which was before played with things. No satisfaction, no agreement has been obtained. But all has been dispute, diversity, and darkness. Insomuch that many of the most learned and judicious Grammarians, disgusted with absurdity and contradictions, have prudently contented themselves with remarking the differences of words, and have left the causes of language to shift for themselves. 
B. � That the methods of accounting for Language remain to this day various, uncertain, and unsatisfactory, cannot be denied. But you have said nothing yet to clear up the paradox you set out with; nor a single word to unfold to us by what means you suppose Hermes has blinded Philosophy. 
H. � I imagine that it is, in some measure, with the vehicle of our thoughts, as with the vehicles for our bodies. Necessity produced both. The first carriage for men was no doubt invented to transport the bodies of those who from infirmity, or otherwise, could not move themselves: But should any one, desirous of understanding the purpose and meaning of all the parts of our modern elegant carriages, attempt to explain them upon this one principle alone, viz. � That they were necessary for conveyance; he would find himself wofully puzzled to account for the wheels, the seats, the springs, the blinds, the glasses, the lining, &c. Not to mention the mere ornamental parts of gilding, varnish, &c. 
Abbreviations are the wheels of language, the wings of Mercury. And though we might be dragged along without them, it would be with much difficulty, very heavily and tediously. 
There is nothing more admirable nor more useful than the invention of signs: at the same time there is nothing more productive of error when we neglect to observe their complication. 
Into what blunders, and consequently into what disputes and difficulties, might not the excellent art of Short-hand writing (practised almost exclusively by the English) lead foreign philosophers ; who not knowing that we had any other alphabet, should suppose each mark to be the sign of a single sound! If they were very laborious and very learned indeed, it is likely they would write as many volumes on the subject, and with as much bitterness against each other, as Grammarians have done from the same sort of mistake concerning Language: until perhaps it should be suggested to them, that there may be not only signs of sounds; but again, for the sake of abbreviation, signs of those signs, one under another in a continued progression. 
B. � I think I begin to comprehend you. You mean to say that the errors of Grammaiians have arisen from supposing all words to be immediately either the signs of things or the signs of ideas: whereas in fact many words are merely abbreviations employed for despatch, and are the signs of other words. And that these are the artificial wings of Mercury, by means of which the Argus eyes of philosophy have been cheated. 
H. � It is my meaning. 
B. � Well. We can only judge of your opinion after we have heard how you maintain it. Proceed, and strip him of his wings. They seem easy enough to be taken off: for it strikes me now, after what you have said, that they are indeed put on in a peculiar manner, and do not, like those of other winged deities, make a part of his body. You have only to loose the strings from his feet, and take off his cap. Come � Let us see what sort of figure he will make without them. 
H. � The first aim of Language was� to communicate our thoughts; the second, to do it with despatch. (I mean intirely to disregard whatever additions or alterations have been made for the sake of beauty, or ornament, ease, gracefulness, or pleasure.) The difficulties and disputes concerning Language have arisen almost intirely from neglecting the consideration of the latter purpose of speech: which, though subordinate to the former, is almost as necessary in the commerce of mankind, and has a much greater share in accounting for the different sorts of words. Words have been called winged; and they well deserve that name, when their abbreviations are compared with the progress which speech could make without these inventions; but compared with the rapidity of thought, they have not the smallest claim to that title. Philosophers have calculated the difference of velocity between sound and light: but who will attempt to calculate the difference between speech and thought! What wonder then that the invention of all ages should have been upon the stretch to add such wings to their conversation as might enable it, if possible, to keep pace in some measure with their minds. � Hence chiefly the variety of words. 
Abbreviations are employed in language three ways: 
1. In terms. 
2. In sorts of words. 
3. In construction. 
Mr. Locke's Essay is the best guide to the first; and numberless are the authors who have given particular explanations of the last. The second only I take for my province at present; because I believe it has hitherto escaped the proper notice of all.
