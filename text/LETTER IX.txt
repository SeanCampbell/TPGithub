LETTER IX
Aprils 9, 1774
WE come now to the consideration of our authors
final sentiments.
I shall not need myself to accompany the Dean throughout this examination, in order to point out the fatal policy of attempting, and total impracticability of
executing, any one of the four first of these schemes, since he has done it so effectually himself as to need no assistance. But though I agree with him in the result, that they are all both impolitic and impracticable, yet I differ widely from him in several arguments introduced in the discussion, and no less in the fundamental principles he frequently argues from. When he talks of the mother country governing, �in the manner she ought to do;� (p. 160) and according to the original terms of the constitution, I presume we are to understand the constitution to be some one individual contract between the mother country and her race of colonies, some certain deed signed and sealed between them and her in due form. Is this the same constitution he told us of in p. 94, of which Magna Charta was the basis? But if terms or conditions be the marks of our constitution, it may indeed be a colony charter, a marriage act, a stamp act, or, in short, any act of Parliament, or of the crown either, so that it will be a matter of very little consequence, whether it have Magna
Charta for its basis, or any basis at all, besides that of the statute in being. Since he lays so much stress on those original terms, by which the colonies are bound to suffer their respectable mother to govern as he thinks �she ought
to do�, let us warn him not to rely too much upon analogical reasoning, since it is apt to prove too much. If he means that Great Britain ought to be obeyed by her colonies, because she is their mother, because (he produced them, and gave them their law, and that her contracts with them, when in their infancy, ought to bind them for ever, he would do well to remember, that no civil contract, between a parent and an infant child, affecting the future property of that child, can possibly have any validity, because of the child's being, at the time, in the power of the parent; because it dares not object to it, it cannot reject any terms she may please to dictate. I need not tell our author, that in the eye of the law, and agreeable to the spirit of the constitution, such a contract is esteemed no better than a fraud, or an act of the grossest tyranny.
   Before I take my final leave of the four first of our author's proposals, I must make two observations upon what appears on the face of them. In the first place, let me request the reader to mark attentively the obvious sentiment, the unambiguous language of the second proposal. When the Dean is off his guard, and when the mistaken principles he adopted, respecting the sovereignty of parliament over America, are fora moment out of sight, see
how naturally, how unavoidably he allows all I contend for! � Here he admits, by direct and unavoidable implication, that parliament hath not the rights of sovereignty over America; he admits, that America is not a part of the British empire, or he could not possibly propose. In the next place, I want to know, when, under the idea of an union, he has proposed to consent, that the seat of
empire be transferred from Great Britain to America, why  �every home-born Englishman should consider it as such an indignity.� � The answer is plain, because he would become a slave; and while America shall be governed at Westminster, the Americans will be slaves. If our dignity consist in governing other nations against their wills, it is a dignity we ought to be ashamed of;
but if it be the genuine offspring, and the associate of our liberty and independence, in God's name let our American kindred enjoy it as well as ourselves.
    We now come to the consideration of the Dean's fifth and last proposal of an amicable and friendly separation, concerning which he very justly demands. This proposal, and the invincible arguments in its support, make ample amends for all the errors in the foregoing parts of his work. He shews himself to be master of this part of his subject; and it cannot be too much recommended to those whom I address in these letters, and to the people in general, to make themselves-well acquainted with what he advances. His much superior knowledge of our American commerce, places the good policy of a separation from America in a much stronger point of light than it was in my power to have done: but I flatter myself, I have sufficiently proved, that we could not have kept that country in subjection without being tyrants. When justice and policy both point the same way, nothing but determined wickedness, or a willful blindness can occasion us to take a wrong course.
With the favour of the reader, I must here repeat one of the first observations I made on the Dean's work, as it strikes me afresh with redoubled force every time I consider it, and that is, that the proposed declaration of the
independence of America, is a conclusion in direct opposition to his original premises. In his abstract reasonings on government, and the relation of colonies to the parent state, he falls � the common fate of genius on slippery abstract ground, into an error in fundamentals, laying it down as a principle, that �parliament hath the rights of sovereignty over America;� and consequently, that �America is actually a part of the British empire.� These are the principles he sets out upon; but behold the result of all his subtle, all his laboured reasonings! � At the end of a second work upon the subject, and after exhausting the chaotic treasuries of sophistry for arguments in support of these principles, he concludes with a proposal to the legislature, to declare that parliament, I doth not claim these rights. Nay, but a minute before,
and, as I have observed, when off his guard, he acknowledges that parliament hath not these rights, and even proposes �to attempt to persuade the colonies to agree to an union.� There is something too irreconcileable in the idea, as before remarked, of giving up one's rights, in order to promote one's interest; but false principles will ever produce fallacious reasonings. How can we
possibly fay more for an amicable separation front America, than that the absolute necessity of it took, as it were by storm, a mind naturally strong and vigorous, and fortified with all the powers of art against the attack! The Dean, in journeying to the great the imperial city of truth, whose eternal foundations occupy a rock that overlooks the country around, unfortunately sets off in
a mist of prejudice. Sometimes he takes a direct contrary course; sometimes intervals of a clearer light keep him steady in the right road; but then again, as the density of the mist either totally obstructs his view, or discovers truth in faint glimmerings, he frequently deviates into bye paths and hollow ways, to the danger of being lost, even when near his journey's end. At last, however, the fun of conviction bursts forth in meridian blaze, the mist is gone, and he arrives at the eternal city. But after having thus proposed a separation and, after having given reasons for it, in opposition to which, I must needs think no man can remain an infidel, who is not at the same time an idiot; our author is, in my opinion, far more faithless, far more hopeless, than at this time there seems cause to be with regard to the execution of his plan. His plan I call it,
since he is, for aught I know to the contrary, the first who hath taken the pains to propose it publicly, and to explain its advantages, although it has been for some time past a common sentiment amongst discerning and liberal-minded men, and to propose it was the first motive to the writing, and the main drift of these letters. It has been more particularly a common sentiment (for indeed
invention itself cannot hit on any other plausible expedient) ever since the late noble and indignant conduct of the Americans in defence of their almost undermined liberty, as this affords a sufficient demonstration to all intelligent minds, in which the love of liberty and justice retained their influence, that the time is come, that they axe determined to be independent of Great Britain, whether it be with her consent or not; whereas I, on my part, firmly believe, that Lord North is the minister who dares to do this great good to his country. He took the helm in a storm, when no other minister was to be found who could guide it; and he has given us, throughout his administration, very ample proofs of his intrepidity. Are we not, at this moment, under a general consternation at what may be the consequences of his intrepidity I shall he dare, in a single act that has no precedent, to shock this whole nation? Shall he dare to hurl a rash and misguided vengeance on the town of Boston, and bid
a bold defiance to all America, and yet want courage to adopt a measure of the greatest wisdom and goodness; a measure which, to execute, he may esteem the glory of his life? The idea is too contradictory for a character so consistent as his. There are conjunctures in the affairs of kingdoms, when none but an intrepid statesman can stem a head-long torrent of popular zeal, or avert a gathering storm which threatens his authority. If the urgent necessity of the cafe shall not admit of temperate measures, but shall demand a daring act of temporary violence, such a statesman, if he be wise and virtuous also, will avail himself of the short-lived calm that succeeds the conflict, and before the discontents of the people can break forth afresh with redoubled and irresistible impetuosity, he will effectually remove them, by removing their causes, and by giving them a security against future alarms. I hope that the late bill will prove only a temporary violence, and that these moments, which are generally thought to be a sullen calm, foreboding some dreadful political convulsion, maybe pregnant with more salutary measures and plans of peace. The remembrance of it will, in a moment, be done away, when Great Britain shall once have done justice to the Americans, by an open declaration of their independence, and by offering them her friendship. Our mutual jealousies
Will be buried in oblivion, and, as the Dean foretels, the Americans will then consider us as  �their protectors, mediators, benefactors.�
I would not have the reader imagine, I mean to justify every tarring and feathering rioter at Boston, and all disorderly proceedings in America indiscriminately. Some of the people, I doubt not, may have been to blame; for the commonalty of that country must have had a portion of wisdom and patience, which hath not at any time before been found in the world, had
all their expressions of resentment for ill usage, been confined within the bounds of moderation. When governors become tyrants, shall we wonder, that an injured and insulted people become riotous and unruly! Have ambitious and encroaching rulers ever yet thought of rendering satisfaction, of making reparation, for the cruellest injuries they have so constantly committed; and
have they not always thought themselves wonderfully gracious and condescending, when they have merely ceased to oppress but is a free people, finding their humble petitions, and most dutiful remonstrances scattered to the winds with contempt, being stung with a sense of accumulated wrongs, and feeling an I indignation at being treated like slaves and villains, do but assault the meanest miscreant in the train of power; 'tis rebellions! felony! treason! - Gaols and gibbets, ball and bayonet, must here be the correctives. Is this human polity! Are these the proceedings of men, of fellow-creatures, of fellow-christians? When merely ceasing to oppress, is all the reparation
required for a long train of injuries and insults; mail authority, with whom wisdom ought ever to reside, become deaf to that voice which called her into being, and think it meritorious to persist in doing wrong? So universally have I heard the Bostonians condemned for destroying the tea, and the action pronounced illegal and rebellious, that I have taken some pains to examine all the particulars of that affair. Now, to my agreeable disappointment, and to the best of my judgment, instead of an act of rebellion, I find it one reflecting honour, and stamping the character of  good subjects, on those who performed it; instead of being illegal, it appears to me to be warranted by the law of nature,  the great original of all human laws, when just. Those who
would wish to think justly, and to speak honestly of this matter, will do well to examine for themselves. When they shall have so done, with care and candour, and admitting on my part, for the sake of taking no advantage in the argument, the Bostonian character to be as black as malignantly represented, I
should be glad to propose to them this plain question: What was possible for the most wise and virtuous persons on earth, in the place of the Bostonians, to have done, in order to have performed their duty to the utmost, towards God and their country? To have shewn a passive obedience to an unjust act of parliament, in a case of such moment, and of so critical a nature, would have been treason to their country, and therefore not acceptable, I imagine, to God. I have introduced in various conversations, with sensible men, the same
question I here propose, but never yet, I can aver with the strictest veracity, have I met with a solution of it, which did , not confirm me in an opinion, that as wise and virtuous men, as good citizens, and true patriots, they could not possibly have acted otherwise than as they did. They had only this one alternative; they were driven to this dilemma by their magistrates, either to suffer an insidious attempt against their sacred rights and liberties to take effect, or to destroy the hated instrument. Having had no other choice, they must necessarily have either done this, or suffered that which ought to have been chosen by every brave and honest man, I leave the reader to determine. 'Tis visionary, even to childishness, to say, they might have permitted the tea to have been landed, and yet have defeated the tax, by unanimously refusing to have purchased it. The conductors of that noble action must have been patriots indeed, and most wonderfully wise, to have left their country, by going this way to work, at the discretion and mercy of the most ignorant and vicious of its inhabitants, to have relied upon the prudence and self-denial of every tea-drinker in America! Besides that the wisdom of each well-meaning individual was not to be depended on for foreseeing all the ill consequences of purchasing a pound of tea, nor their resolution in preventing them; I fear there might have been some traitors to the public cause, some tools of government or the India Company, or some suspected persons at least, in whom to have confided, for not setting the example, and using all their cunning to seduce others, would not have argued any extraordinary degree of prudence. What teacher of morals or politics, ever was lunatic enough to
build all his hopes of serving his country, on an expectation of bringing every individual of it to be of one mind, and as unanimously to act up to the same rigid principle of virtue? And which of us would care to risk the safety of the city of London from some dreadful calamity, on a confidence that every female, from the fine lady to the washerwoman, every man, from the minister of state down to the blackguard, might be prevailed upon totally to abstain from the use of tea, porter, or gin, except the temptation was removed out of their way.
   To all my readers, except those unhappy ones, who have learned the fatal art of occasionally closing the mental eye, so as to admit just so much, and no more of the light of truth as their passions and prejudices will bear; I must needs think, it would be reflecting upon their understandings and their ingenuousness, to attempt any farther proof of my proposition, that  the Bostonians did what was strictly consonant to right and justice in destroying the tea ; but, in order to open the self-closed, winking eyes of the prejudiced, I will propose one more comparison, which, I apprehend, will be admitted as a fair one, since it is agreed on all hands, except by the calm advancers of
direct falsehoods and lies, and the bold denyers of demonstration, that with regard to taxation, the colonists, as legitimate shoots from a parent stock of freedom, have at least an equal right to be their own tax-masters as the people of Ireland, which was a conquered, and every one knows, a very rebellious kingdom for many ages. Let then the reader only substitute Ireland and Dublin, for Massachuset's Bay and Borkin, and try the cause over again in his own mind. If he pleases, he will suppose, that instead of a duty on tea, we would attempt to touch the pockets of the Irish, by a duty on certain stamped
papers, being publications of gross immoralities and blasphemies, tending to debauch the minds of the people, and fit them for slavery; and that an association of honest citizens of Dublin, more mindful of their duty to God and their country, than of obedience to an ordinance they held to be subversive of
their liberties, should find this precious cargo, precisely in a similar situation with the tea at Boston; that the Lord Mayor, the magistrates, and revenue myrmidons, like the Boston governor and officers of customs, should all absolutely refuse their permission and clearances for its departure from the port, and the ship should be well imprisoned by surrounding batteries; then, what is to be done? what course is to be pursued? Shall those, who ought to be the guides and guardians of the city, admit these pernicious compositions within their walls; patiently behold them displayed in the shops, hawked about the streets, and dispersed throughout the country with every art of invitation to those inclined to purchase? Is the city to be deluged with these impieties, and its manners, morals, and liberties undermined, rather than an united company of merchants trading in mischief should lose their property? a property not only detrimental in itself, but in this case made a venture, with
the direct intention of betraying a brave and generous nation into obedience to a despotic ordinance, containing in it the seeds of a more complete tyranny, and used as the most tempting bait to lure the silly multitude into the political mousetrap; and therefore, on the principles of self-preservation, and
agreeable to the spirit of the law of nature and nations, subject to be destroyed, if not removed upon fair warning. Are the city guardians, I say, to observe all this, and content themselves all the while with a patriotic resolve, not to buy or to read a single paper, and with preaching to the unlistening
people to follow their example? If this, in the enlightened and virtuous city of Dublin, would be an experiment, that even a driveller would hardly dream of making; how much less safe would it have been for the American patriots to have hazarded their all, on the universal good sense, on the piety and public spirit of the people, in the stupid, the hypocritical the impious, the ungrateful, and rebellious town of Boston! What then, I once more ask, ought the patriots of Dublin or qf Boston to have done? What! but with indignation to have cast the hated instrument of tyranny into the sea! whither its proprietors deserved also to have followed it headlong. Is it for this wise, brave, and generous action, that not only the actors of it, but the whole people of Boston, are now smarting under the heaviest vengeance of Great Britain! of a people who have hitherto justly prided themselves in being the undaunted resisters of tyrants! Fie, boasters, fie! Britannia blushes for your degeneracy; she disowns ye for her sons. When a pawnbroker knowingly puts arms into the hands of a
highwayman or ruffian, does any law insure to him payment for the same, at the hands of any one who, being assaulted, seized and destroyed them? Are not all deadly weapons, all snares, traps, and poisons, made use of in violation to the laws of civil society, for injuring any man in life, limb, or property, a lawful spoil to the injured party? When the miscreant, pick-pocket Jew, in the service of iniquity, was once driving a trade amongst the Westminster school-boys, with a parcel of TEA, out of the green cannister of the celebrated Mrs.
Phillips, who, that had a spark of virtuous indignation, but applauded the illegal proceedings of the spirited master, when, disregarding the laws of property, he threw into the fire all of this tea he could lay his hands on ; and, as little considering the penalties for an assault, horsed the vile factor, and scourged him to the quick?
   I must therefore repeat, that the destroyers of the tea at Boston were, in my opinion, a band of virtuous patriots, whose names, when once made public, will doubtless be held in eternal veneration by their countrymen; and that the glorious illegality (if every statute, whether just or unjust, be properly comprehended in the word law) they achieved, was an act of absolute moral and political necessity, and therefore exempt from even good laws; of singular wisdom, of strict justice, and remarkable temper and forbearance, considering their provocations, since it was done in self-defence, with the greatest good
Order and decency, and unaccompanied with incivility to any one, or the smallest damage to any thing in the ships besides the treacherous tea. I must likewise repeat, that this tea, for the reasons I have given, and agreeable to the spirit of the law of nature and nations, was justly forfeited to the injured Americans; and that the East India Company are not entitled to any satisfaction or payment for the same.
