LETTER X and Last
April 14, 1774
NOTHING now remains to be spoken of but the act of parliament necessary to that separation, proposed by the reverend author of the tracts, and seconded in these letters; and that general treaty between Great Britain and the states of America, which will be the necessary, and doubtless the immediate consequence of it. When parliament shall have duly weighed this great, this
important matter, � the greatest by far that ever came before any national council whatever !�with the attention it merits, and in the temper recommended in my first letter, we may hope to see a nemine contradkente act, whose preamble shall run in some such form as the following. 
   Although, by those unhappy persons, who have no just ideas of right and wrong, and who have not intellects for perceiving, that the original power of Great Britain over her colonies, is on the point of expiring beyond all help and remedy, parliament may be supposed to be a loser by the proposed separation; yet all must confess, that his Majesty will be a gainer, inasmuch as he will thereby receive fifteen independent kingdoms in exchange for as many dependent, and hardly dependent provinces, and become the father of three millions of free and happy subjects, instead of reigning joint tyrant over so many discontented slaves, or losing by revolt so many of his people. What a divine glow of satisfaction must expand the royal bosom on an event so full of bliss, so consonant to humanity and to virtue! � an event more full of real lustre � more aggrandizing by many degrees than ever before
was experienced by any earthly monarch. � How poor, how contemptible, how hateful the triumphs of butchering conquerors compared to this solid glory! May such a transcendant glory be the glory of George the Third!
   We must not be surprized if shallow and designing men, some with real, some with affected ignorance, should cry out, �What! enter into treaty with fifteen independent states, and expect them unanimously to join with you in one general league for mutual advantage and security! How chimerical and visionary the project!� And I do not doubt, but that the swarm of hireling and
prostitute scribblers, whose food is confusion, and whose very existence, like the vermin in an ulcer, is supported by the diseases of the state, will pour forth all their malignity, in order to discredit, and to damn, if possible, a plan so wise and salutary. But their baneful influence will not, I trust, extend itself farther than to disturb, for a short time, the confused minds of our coffee-house politicians. It will still be obvious to all sensible men, especially to those who compose the national council, that when Great Britain shall have done the noblest act of injustice towards the Americans, that the annals of mankind can produce, they will as one man, fly to her for protection, court her friendship, submit themselves to her advice, and be ready to put into her hands a chart 
blanche; and so long as she continues to act upon the same principles, she may undoubtedly influence each separate state, and dictate the terms of general accommodation, without any fear of even future dissatisfactions. To deny 
these conclusions, would be to deny that effects follow their causes. The author of the tracts has already proved, that it is not our power, but the superior advantage of our trade, which secures to us the commerce of the Americans, or that can secure it to us. We shall still have the same power to awe America into a faithful observance of her treaties that we now have, to enforce a disputed and odious sovereignty, and with this manifest advantage, that treating with each state separately, we shall only have one at a time to contend with; whereas we have experienced, by our stamp and tea projects, that while we pretend to govern the whole, the whole will unite to resist us. That bond of union once dissolved, and the natural and necessary jealousy of each other taking place, Great Britain, as the common umpire, will become in effect the general sovereign, so long as she interposes her good offices for maintaining the common independence; and this her own interest will always dictate. Great Britain will of course take care, in the first place, to recover all her debts in America, which, instead of bad debts, as they are now too justly esteemed to be, will, in the transports of their gratitude for a declared and guaranteed independence, be punctually paid, tho' with their last shilling.
Not to mention that fear of offending, (for Great Britain will then become truly formidable to each separate state) would effectually produce this effect, we shall, by the league secure on the most lasting foundation, every advantage of trade with America we now enjoy, and by the separation relieve ourselves from many heavy expences it now costs us; for a proof of which, I again refer to the
Dean's work: we may then disband so much our expensive and unconstitutional standing army, as we now keep upon account of America; and instead of being execrated, as we now are, for that fleet which blocks up
their ports, and is commissioned to humble Boston to the dust, and through her sides, to gall every province on the continent, they will readily consent to its presence for seeing to the exact fulfilling of their treaties, and they
will then look upon it with a friendly, an affectionate and respectful eye, while they consider it as their sure protector against invasion, their refuge in distress, and the avenger of their wrongs. � Not being able to pay Great
Britain in subsidies of ready money for her protection and friendship, they will grant her an equivalent in exclusive trade; and they will enter into some general stipulation for the mode and the measure of payment for any such extraordinary assistance of strips as they may at any time solicit, or we, penetrating the designs of our common enemies, may send to their assistance. As for troops, a country containing millions of inhabitants never can
want any: let them rely upon the natural, the best resource � a national militia; but, for heaven's sake! never more let the face of a British soldier be seen in North America. A Flanders or a Germany, on the other side of the globe, would be a grave wide enough to swallow the whole strength and treasure of this kingdom. The Americans are in no condition to set themselves up as a maritime power, or to support a navy fit to guard their own coasts, but must rely upon Great Britain for their safety by sea, as indeed it will ever be their interest so to do, knowing by experience, that with regard to them, she is not a conquering, but a commercial state; and having reason to conclude, that a confederacy of their maritime states would probably terminate, like that of Greece, in wars upon one another, and be perverted to answer the ends of ambition to some one, instead of protection to all. After what has been said, I need not point out (but for the sake of my timid and uninformed-reader) that it will be totally unnecessary, and unbecoming the dignity of parliament, to hesitate a moment in passing the act of declaration, for fear the Americans should not afterwards consent to the league. 'Tis absurd to imagine they will
act in contradiction to the principles of self-interest and self-preservation, merely because they shall be free from control; nor is it more possible to conceive, how they should object to a treaty with Great Britain, merely because she had just done them an act of magnanimity and generosity unparallelled in history, and given them an undeniable proof, that she was intitled to their unbounded Confidence, particularly in its not being possible she should have any design upon their liberties. Besides Great Britain, until she have resigned her assumed sovereignty as the mother country, cannot, on the principles of equity, as before illustrated, give any validity to a contract with her children, while held in subjection to her authority. No! the generous spirit that shall set them free, will disdain the meanness of a proceeding so little and so distrustful; and that wisdom which could form so comprehensive a plan, will despise the crookedness and folly of such a narrow policy. 
   Thus have I given a faint sketch of the many and great benefits of an American league � the reader's imagination and judgment will finish the picture. If then he can think, that they do not infinitely preponderate against
the advantages to be hoped for from persisting to assert our odious sovereignty, and plundering the colonies by arbitrary tax-gatherers, I have only to say, that he and I can scarcely be made of the fame common materials of humanity; but I shall begin to listen to those profound sages, whose acute penetration, assisted by a certain microscopic species of philosophy, hath discovered, that the Mosaic revelation is a fable, and that, instead of one,
there are indeed many different races of men. On the one hand, the most we can expect is a forced and reluctant submission, with some advantages in trade; but these even for a very, very short period. Mean while, discontent and detestation, brooding in the bosoms of the colonists, will naturally generate a rancorous hate and abhorrence; which, aided by our restless enemies the
French, will shortly terminate in defiance and revenge. On the other hand � but repetition is needless. In short, the multiplying millions of America, must either be our foes, or our steadfast friends. � Great Britain, take thy choice! 
   What remains, but that we renew our appeal to the manly sense and magnanimity of the great council of this kingdom; a kingdom, great and happy above all the kingdoms of the earth; a council the most august in the whole world, as nursed in the bosom of freedom, and trained in the true principles of just government and pure religion, of which they are the guardians! If men, thus favoured of heaven, thus enlightened, thus elevated, shall not set examples of sterling virtue, where, alas! shall we find it? Consult then your own hearts, ye legislators of Great Britain! Be true to your own feelings, and let the moral sense prevail. If ye are conscious of a love of power, know that 'tis the genuine offspring of the love of liberty. This the root, that the branch. If
your hearts be held in-the curling branch's close embrace, think how, in the hearts of all men, the tenacious root strikes to the bottom, and twines it's clasping fibres around the very springs of life, never to lose their hold! Remember that ye are now to decide on the fate of nations �� perhaps your own. Remember the great legislator beholds your doings. Be your doings like unto his doings. Be tender to humanity; be firm to freedom; be inflexible to justice. Emancipate in one god-like act, a long roll of nations, whose names it is tedious to recount. In one act, lift up the well-pleasing name of Great Britain to heaven, and spread her matchless fame to the ends of the wondering earth. The depth of her wisdom, the transcendency of her virtue, shall be unexampled, and this act remain a monument of her great felicity, an ever-
lasting model of justice, and a theme of praise to all nations, and to all ages. Potentates have, unto dethroned princes, restored their ravished dominions; renowned monarchs, fated with ambition, and the abuse of authority, have, in the plenitude of their power, abdicated thrones; heroes and patriots have given freedom to their native countries; but for the present legislators of Great
Britain was reserved the superior, the supreme glory of bestowing in a foreign soil, liberty on millions! 
In order to obviate some objections, which, I foresee, both well-meaning and ill-designing persons may be ready to offer to this part of my proposal, let me observe to them, that this association will not be attended with those difficulties and embarrassments, which their imaginations or their artifice may possibly suggest. We may presume, that our commissioners would
have the outlines of the proposed league ready sketched out, from the most approved general regulations of the acts of trade and navigation, which now relate to the colonies collectively and taking in such other conditions as should be evidently calculated for the mutual benefit of Great Britain and North America; one as the planting, the other as the manufacturing country; one as the client, the other as the patron. This general league might be very concise, compared with national treaties in common; it might be extremely perspicuous, and so clearly established on principles of equity and common advantage to leave the American deputies without a pretence, or a desire to propose any but flight alterations, and without a possibility of not acceding to it with the utmost readiness and satisfaction; and it is still less likely, there should be any insuperable difficulties started by them, when they should come to enter into their respective separate treaties.
   How the trade of a colony can be limited, and its manufactures restricted by the mother-country, on the principles of justice, except with its own free consent, I confess I have not eyes to discover. If it can be made appear, that the British parliament hath a right to say to an American, �you shall not make
a hat to cover your head, nor a shoe to defend your foot; you shall not manufacture a piece of cloth to keep out the cold, nor a knife wherewithal to cut your victuals;� why, I pray, may it not likewise say, �give us the money out of your pocket?� To obtain a little money, may be thought, and by Mr. Grenville and his disciples was thought, as convenient to the state, as the employment of our manufacturers. Observing, that not only the unreasoning multitude, but the members in both houses of parliament, minority as well as majority, not even excepting the honest opposers of American taxation, all seemed to agree, that Great Britain hath a right to bind the colonies by her regulations and restrictions in and upon their trade, navigation and manufactures; I, for a long time, suffered my own reason to be borne down, and my feelings suppressed by the weight of such respectable, though not
infallible authority; but, the self-evident fallaciousness of this proposition for ever recurring upon me, and striking my mind with redoubled force very time I considered it, I was at last obliged to yield to the force of an irresistible internal conviction, and to reject that doctrine as erroneous, and as a national
prejudice, arising from precedents, established by the mother-country, when her children were helpless new-born babes, and carefully instilled into their minds while growing up, as among the sacred precepts of filial piety; from the self-flattering and self-interested suggestions of British minds; and from
the general acknowledgment of the Americans themselves.
   But why, I want to know, are the colonies to be held for ever in the situation of cities besieged? Why is the mother-country to be the sole judge of such restrictions as may be consistent with the original intention of settling colonies; seeing that this original intention was not, in some cases, the intention of the legislature, but the intention of the emigrants themselves, when they fled from persecution, misery, and want, to take shelter in the more friendly wilds of America? Why are the selfish and arbitrary terms prescribed by one party, to be implicitly received by the other, in a commercial affair of mutual concern, and professed by the dictating party, to be for their mutual advantage? Voluntary consent and agreement, independent bargain and contract, are in the very essence of all equitable dealings in trade. I presume the Americans may be as good judges, as the people who ridiculously assume the right of judging for them, what it is their advantage to restrict themselves
to in manufactures and trade; and will be ready to take care to confine themselves to such branches, as will be most consistent with that first political maxim, of securing, at all events, the protection of Great Britain, and her valuable trade, from which they have benefits to expect, that no other European market can yield them, To acknowledge their independency, and to
form with them a friendly league, is therefore the only method, on the principles of equity, of laying them under restrictions in trade and manufactures, for the exclusive advantage of their protectors; but continuing to impose these restrictions by our own authority, and by force, as it deeply effects them in their property, by preventing money coming into their pockets, (which is very nearly allied, when done unjustly, to taking it out of
their packets without their consent) is undoubtedly tyrannical. 
   When our legislators, and others, divesting themselves of every selfish and arbitrary bias, (the characteristics of little and uncultivated minds) and guarding against all suggestions, but those of truth, justice, and benevolence, shall have duly reflected on this very important question, I flatter myself they
will perceive the wisdom of our anticipating the Americans in a candid discussion of it, and will agree with me, in sentiment, that America cannot, according to any ideas of justice or freedom, be laid under restrictions of any kind, for the purpose of strengthening and aggrandizing the state or legislature of Great Britain, except with her free will and consent, independently and voluntarily given by express stipulation and contract; and consequently, that they will see the moral as well as the political necessity, for the proposed declaration and league; and that, in fact, it remains for Great Britain to choose, whether by acting the deaf and haughty tyrant, she shall sink herself into poverty and contempt, or, by a conduct worthy herself and her boasted knowledge, and love of freedom, she shall render herself, not only the all-powerful guarantee of the independence, and monopolizer of the trade of America, but at the same time the dreaded, the dictatorial arbiter of Europe.
