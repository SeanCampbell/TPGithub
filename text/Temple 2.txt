EARL TEMPLE TO MR. WILKES
April 28, 1768
Sir, � I little thought that I should ever pay a visit to the King's Bench Prison; but the same opinions
which carried me to see you in the Tower now incite me to take an opportunity (before I leave town for the summer, which I purpose doing forthwith) of returning my thanks to you in person for your sober and discreet conduct of yesterday, manifested in a dutiful submission to the law, though carried on against you with the most unnecessary rigour, by refusing bail.
I applaud your wise and humane discouragement of all tumult and disorder, in which I doubt not but you will persevere.
Though I have not seen you for many years, yet I shall bring with me the same heart warm for the support of the just rights and dignity of the Crown, and for the defence of the constitutional privileges of Englishmen, violated in so many instances in your person.
What will be the most convenient and quiet time for you to receive me. I do nothing in the dark, and am in the face of day, Sir, your most obedient humble servant, Temple.
EARL TEMPLE TO THE COUNTESS OF CHATHAM
April 28, 1768
I think I am not out in my guess, though perhaps I might not be intelligible to yourself. There is a material difference betwixt words spoken y a person, and committed to writing by him. Be that as it may, I shall be happy, whenever the proper time comes of speaking to you with that real affection and esteem which I bear to you, enhanced, if possible, by this kind attention. Had you been of a certain journey, perhaps things had turned out better.
The latter part of your letter is grievous to me.
Though my note was dated at night, yet it was not sent till after breakfast. It was disposed of to the safest hand I could place it in, who gave it to a porter, and saw it delivered in at your house. What will these strange times produce! This will be sent the same way, and probably about the same time.

From the contents of my notes in answer to yours, you cannot be a stranger to the sentiments I entertain of you, and I am glad I have had such an opportunity of expressing them; they have been invariably the same towards you. The amiable part which you have taken I shall ever reflect upon with much affection.
The proper time for our meeting again is certainly not the present, for many many reasons. I have felt too well your situation, not to have done a violence to my own inclination towards you in many instances. I return you, with great kindness, every real wish for your health and happiness. My letter to you from Stowe was expressive of the same sentiments with regard to you as those I have lately marked, and now convey to you. It is extremely difficult for me to say neither too much nor too little upon the subject of your difficulty and affliction, &c I therefore waive it entirely, and approve your conduct; with wishes for that recovery in which you are so deeply interested.
EARL TEMPLE TO THE EARL OF SUFFOLK.
Stowe, January 24, 1771.
My dear Lord,�Retired as I am and wish to be, it is impossible, however, that any important change in your Lordship's private or public situation, can be indifferent to me. Our private intercourse for some years past, our public warfare in so many glorious days of battle against the common enemy, and your great talents, forbid it. As I am entirely a stranger to every circumstance of this business, but the tenderest recollections of our common loss, your Lordship can only receive my thanks for the obliging manner in which you have communicated to me the step which you have taken, attended with my good wishes, that your Lordship may have reason to be better satisfied with your new situation than my experience of the Court, and of the public, can allow me to hope for you.
I have the honour to be, with the greatest respect, your Lordship's most obedient and most humble servant, Temple.
EARL TEMPLE TO THE EARL OP CHATHAM
September 8, 1772
My dear Lord, � Though I never can be tired of any business in which I am engaged in your service, and that I execute it with zeal you and yours have allowed, yet, as these are of different sorts, some may, to a kind well-wisher, be in their nature more agreeable than others.
At my return to this place, on Sunday last, I found your Lordship's letter, together with one of the 4th from that facetious man of business, in so many departments, Mr. Thomas Nuthall, whose fellow is not easily to be met with: witness your marriage-settlement not witnessed, his peremptory and repeated assertions, that your trustee had no power to advance the trust-money on mortgage, even though I quoted the very words to him, and his late unparalleled proceedings, which the better to ascertain, I send you copies of the letters which have already passed, leaving the comparison of his letters to you and me, the dates, the contradictions, and the comments to your Lordship, who cannot fail to see that though he was trusted for all, and only referred to Mr. Madocks as a matter of form, upon his own suggestion, yet he was in utrumque paratus, if you had wished otherwise than you did, and I would have been paid with jargon; for my own part, I am in no wise concerned but for the honour of the trust, and to silence whispers which his irregularity had produced.
After many and many disappointments, I am now going on prosperously here. The north side is charming, and the south will be very magnificent, attended with much expense, but, what is worse, with infinite trouble. I hope, however, that the worst is over. For Hagley news I have none to add to what you must have heard from the once young and lovely lips of Madame Hood. It is a charming place, and I think we have got an amiable and very sensible acquisition in our new cousin.
To-morrow I enter upon the delights of a race at Newport Pagnel, of which proh pudor! I am a steward. I hear your young folks have again greatly signalized themselves, which cannot but give pleasure to papa and mama, as well as to, my dear Lord, your most affectionate, Temple.
I rely with the fullest security on your Lordship's honour, but not at all on Mr. Nuthall's law, when he tells me that the method now taken is full as safe and effectual as if Mr. Walpole had conveyed to the trustee, for, if you had given a general mortgage, or a judgment in the interim, they would take place.
EARL TEMPLE TO THE BAILIFF AND BURGESSES OF THE
BOROUGH OF BUCKINGHAM
September, 1776
Gentlemen, � Having been informed of the eloquent oration delivered by the Earl of Verney, in your Town Hall, to his own tenants and others, in consequence of a meeting advertised to be holden here, for the express purpose of considering of an application to Parliament, to enable the parish in the ordinary way to rebuild their parish church, I am not a little surprised to hear that his Lordship was pleased, in so peremptory a manner, to call upon the Corporation, and the friends thereof, to take upon themselves to do what so peculiarly belongs to the possessors of lands in the parish of which his Lordship enjoys so very considerable a share. I trust that neither the one nor the other will be thus dictated to-by him. He adduced, it seems, some notable precedents to favour these his commands, the most remarkable of which was his own generosity to the town of Carmarthen where he was a perfect stranger. What were the advantageous terms of that bargain to his Lordship I know not, but I doubt not they were good.
In this Corporation we neither buy nor are sold, being unused to any unworthy traffic of that kind. His Lordship will, I dare say, be to hear, that the estate of the Corporation is scarce equal to the necessary expenses thereof; that it was a parish meeting advertised by the churchwardens, with his privity, for the expressed purpose of an application to Parliament, to enable the parish to rebuild the church; that at this meeting, in their corporate capacity, the Corporation had no special concern; that the revenues of the parish considerably exceed 4000� a year; that the bailiff and burgesses, in order to save his pocket, and that of other great land proprietors, will not take his private hint of selling themselves to Lord North, nor, indeed, to any borough-monger whatever; that they should have rather expected to have heard from so respectable a member of the Opposition, of precedents which testify to the commitment of the Mayor and Corporation of Oxford to Newgate, and of General Smith and Mr. Hollis to the King's Bench, for practices not so corrupt as the proposed application to the King's Minister. Such a hint partakes less of the generous and disinterested sentiments which should animate the representative of an independent County, than of that meaner sort which sometimes recommends Court Members to poor boroughs for a valuable consideration, when the poor are sold, and a profit made on their perjury. On my behalf, who have the honour to rank myself as a sincere friend and servant of this Corporation, I shall only say at present, that I trust you are convinced that I and my family are too sensible of the many obligations you have conferred upon us, to hesitate a moment, when any proper opportunity offers, of manifesting the great respect and affection which we bear towards a set of gentlemen, who have acted with a friendship and generosity scarce to be parallelled, and worthy of better times. It is the honour of a late friend of this Corporation, to have chalked out the most effectual means hitherto proposed, of detecting and punishing corrupt and scandalous violations of the constitution, so justly alarming to every good man. Here it may he pleaded as a merit, and we flatter ourselves that a time may come, when the actors in such foul practices, [the great vulgar as well as the little will, in consequence thereof, be more fully detected and brought to condign punishment.
The interested proposition of his Lordship being thus negatived, you will be to hear from him, as first proprietor of lands, what he has to offer on a subject where he has taken so extraordinary a lead, and I desire that the contents of this letter may be communicated to the meeting. Whatever plan may be proposed to save the purse of great and considerable landholders, I shall think very unbecoming: ready to facilitate every fair and reasonable mode for the accomplishment of so desirable an end as rebuilding your church, and happy at all times in proving to you the sincere regard, gratitude, and affection with which I am, &cl, &c Temple.
Before estimates had been called for, it might have been proper to have fixed where the church is to be built, and by what means it is to be paid for.
EARL TEMPLE TO MR. GEORGE GRENVILLE
September 1777
As I cannot find in my heart to tear myself from my Stowe solitude, even for the sake of the amiable society of Gosfield, it becomes necessary I should at last thus open to you the result of a very distressed mind, on the subject of our plan of living together for better and worse; and first, I must express to you my hearty thanks for the kind readiness with which you offered to sacrifice your new walls and old waters, even all the clay of the beloved Wotton, to the friendly object of endeavouring to render my heavy loss the more supportable; but having now had some experience of that solitude after which my affliction hath sighed, and finding myself still wholly unequal to that society which the gaiety of youth calls for, and necessarily occasions, I would deliver you and myself from the constraints which the great difference of gray hairs and green heads must create, notwithstanding all the sacrifices your good-nature and Lady Mary's would make. . Past recollections for ever haunt me. I know not with certainty which way to turn, nor, therefore, what will become even of Stowe or Pall Mall, but I hold that it is wiser, in due time, retrorsum vela dare, than to prosecute further an experimental voyage through seas unknown, in which so many able navigators have been shipwrecked; at least I would wish to lay in my claim at present, so far as more to shape things gradually, in a manner to occasion the fewest comments on restoring matters to their ancient footing, not like the Americans going back to 1764, but only to the beginning of the fatal month of April. It might be better had we never been tempted to put to sea at all, but by it you have at least got to the full knowledge of your own crew, a science which will prove useful to your pocket and to your credit, and you have made almost a clear ship: your wines are entire, your plate unmelted, and such of your property as has been removed may be most easily returned, your finances will not have suffered, and all the blame shall lie at the door of my wretchedness.
Sound discretion, in general, declares that a joint voyage through life should never be undertaken but in the course of wedlock, so that though the full consummation of our matrimonial contract appears to be in many lights very desirable, yet, as it must be attended with many of the constraints and evils of that state, in an age, too, not very favourable to it, deprived, at the same time, of many of its most precious sweets, even Mr. Cleaver himself would hesitate at such an alliance of Church and State.
I have written this with the less reluctance, since I am clear Lady Mary and you will look upon it as a release. The sevants you still leave at Wotton, and the keeping it as you mean to do, manifest to me where the treasure is, and, in consequence, the sacrifice you have been making. I, like Lord N., must be a wanderer through life, though, in my probably short pilgrimage, I am never likely to stray into happiness.
As we have not had the smallest altercation, the town tea tables will be the less able to give in their respectable verdict upon this appearance of change. In all events I shall continue to love you and Lady Mary, and to show myself, my dear nephew's most truly affectionate, T.
