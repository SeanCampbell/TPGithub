LETTER VI
March 27, 1774
WHEN we talk of asserting our sovereignty over the Americans, do we foresee to what fatal lengths it will carry us? Are not those nations increasing with astonishing rapidity? Must they not, in the nature of things, cover in a few ages that immense continent like a swarm of bees? Do we vainly imagine, that we can then hold the reins of government, and hurl our thunders on the heads of the disobedient? Where are we to stop? or, shall we pretend to circumscribe American populations? To say, "Thus far ye shall go, and no farther?" � No!  �. Swollen indeed must we be with the pride of dominion, and drunk with the fumes, if we can foolishly imagine these things. It is high time that we opened our eyes to the unintentional encroachments we have been making upon the liberties of mankind, and to the necessity of setting bounds to our dominion. Without the American continent, the British empire will be large enough in all
reason. But if government persist in maintaining our sovereignty there, it may possibly occasion our own destruction, but can be productive of no good to us, either present or future. After all that has been done to alarm the Americans for their fights as free men, and calling up their attention to a thorough investigation of them; after the flame of opposition hath been kindled in
every breast, and now animates them as one man, it will be in vain to steer any middle course; to adopt measures for light oppressions, and compelling obedience to laws moderately tyrannical. We must either relinquish at once our claim to sovereignty, or fix on their neck with strong hand the galling yoke of slavery. We must either conquer ourselves or them. Justice, wisdom, humanity, and religion, leave us without a doubt which to prefer; and, should the latter be determined on, woe be to Great Britain! We may, indeed, by means of fleets and armies, maintain a precarious tyranny over the Americans for a while; but the most shallow politicians must foresee what this would end in. It would expose us to the certain attacks of all our European rivals; and, when we found the necessity of courting the assistance of the Americans, we should deservedly find them the bitterest of our enemies. With the nations of Europe we contend for commerce, for glory, and some imaginary objects; with those of America, the contest would be for the dearest rights, the very dignity of humanity. After the struggles of interest and prowess, a tolerable reconciliation may take place, but eternal enmity and hate always succeed those between a free people and their tyrants. From the spirit of freedom, which hath in all ages glowed in the bosoms of true Englishmen, and which hath brought to its present perfection our glorious constitution in defiance
of every attempt to crush it; we ought to know, that until we can extinguish this spirit in the breasts of the Americans, and eradicate from their very nature its first and noblest principles, self-preservation and free-will, that all our efforts to bow them down in subjection to our authority, must finally be ineffectual, and will recoil sooner or later, perhaps with ten-fold retribution upon ourselves. There are some politicians who think, that present expediency is a sufficient justification of any measures; and who, from the ideas of reimbursing ourselves for the charges of the last war, of supplying the present exigencies of the state, and securing our power over the American commerce, make no scruple to bid us draw the accursed sword, and enslave our children and our brethren. But, be it known to them, that though our very existence as a nation, depended on violating the express laws of God, it must not be done. And if their ignorance, which may be implied from the folly of their proposal,
hath not yet made the discovery, let them be told that policy, national as well as individual, must have justice and the laws of God for its basis, or, 'tis the policy of villains, the policy of sots and fools. Can the legislature of Great Britain, I once more ask, govern the Americans on the true principles of freedom? For the reasons I have already given, I believe it to be impossible. As
to their reimbursing us the sums of money spent on their account in the last war, they will do it, if we act wisely and justly, in the only way it is possible they should, and in the only way we expected of them when we underfoot
the war; that is, by a commerce beneficial to this kingdom. And by leaving them to their own independency, the charges of government may be greatly retrenched.
   Thus far had I written, when the political tracts of a reverend Dean fell into my hands. They amply supply all the examples and explanations necessary to illustrate my principles, and shew to a demonstration the absolute necessity, in a political light, of relinquishing our claims to the sovereignty of America; to which the whole tenour of my letters point, and with which they are to conclude. But I am far from subscribing to this gentleman's doctrine as to the rights of sovereignty. If I could acknowledge the truth of that, I should very much doubt of the propriety of his proposed separation of America from Great Britain; for giving up one's right, cannot be thought a good rule for promoting one's interest. But in this cafe, as is very frequent, his common-sense hath been obliged to subdue his learning before he arrived at truth. While metaphysical refinements teach him to think, that Britain hath a right to govern America, the invincible force of truth extorts from him an acknowledgment that she must, if governed by true policy, relinquish it. 'Tis
pity so able a writer had not discovered, that the Americans have a right to choose their own governors, and t thence inforced the necessity of his proposed separation as a religious duty, no less than a measure of national policy. In so doing, he would have been consistent; there would then have been no obscurity; nor would his sentiments of right and expediency have been at variance; but his conclusion would naturally and evidently have
flowed from his premises, supported by that trite, but true and most excellent maxim, that honesty is the best policy. But, perhaps, some may be of opinion, that the propriety of a separation is more strongly enforced, by its appearing to be the only result he could possibly arrive at through the medium of opinions that pointed the direct contrary way. The same opinions have, in all other writers, led them only to consider, by what means the unity of the whole British empire (taking in America) might be best preserved; how the supreme legislative power might be best supported, and enforce obedience to the utmost bounds of this vast dominion. Every project for this purpose (without a single exception) being embarrassed with a fundamental incompatibility, a radical error in supposing a right, where, in truth, there is none, hath been
visionary, oppressive, sanguinary, and totally impracticable; so difficult it is to strive against the stream of nature and truth.
   The Dean, with more good sense, with an extensive insight into the human heart, and the springs of commerce, and with the temper of a philosophic, uninterested looker-on, hath nobly abandoned the full persuasion of his own mind on the point of right; and, while he thirties we are entitled to govern, foresees and demonstrates the fatal consequences of attempting it. He accordingly advises us to separate in good humour, and trusts to our
mutual interests for its producing, in fact, a real and sincere union. What can more fully prove the right of independence in colonies, too far removed to be governed on the principles of freedom by the mother country, than this universal, this uniform, invariable feeling of all mankind, in all ages, than that "it is the nature of them all to aspire after it." Shall we reject the unvarying testimony of nature speaking home to our hearts, and pin our faith upon the fine-spun, cobweb subtleties of our learned casuists and court-lawyers? or shall we, with more safety, rely upon the letter of an old musty charter, penned before this question was so much as thought of? Hath nature left herself so much without a witness to the truth in the human breast, that we must give ourselves wholly up to the direction of such blind guides as these? Fie! fie! If much learning hath not made us mad, it hath at least in this, and many similar
cafes, made us ignorant. It is to be lamented, that such a blaze of truth, as there is in the above observation, did not discover to the writer the fallaciousness of his original position of parliamentary right to govern the colonies; when all the while, it is the express, the sole purport of this work to prove, that parliament, in continuing to assert this right, cannot promote either the welfare of Great Britain or America.
