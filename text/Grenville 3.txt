MR. GRENVILLE TO THE EARL OF SUFFOLK
July 14, 1767
My dear Lord, � You will have heard, before this can reach you, of the negotiation which has been opened with Lord Rockingham, by a message from the King through the Duke of Grafton, which was delivered at a meeting which they had at General Conway's house, on Tuesday last, the 7th of this month. The message was, that the King wished that Lord Rockingham and his friends might form his Administration, and that he intended his Lordship should resume the office of First Lord of the Treasury. Lord Rockingham having asked whether he was at liberty to communicate this to others besides his own friends, was answered, that the question had been foreseen, and that he might communicate it; but it seemed intended that this was meant to the Duke of Bedford and his friends only. After this conference, the Duke of Grafton went the next day to Newmarket, and was to stay there till yesterday, when Lord Rockingham was to make his proposals, and in the mean time he has neither seen nor heard from the King. The account of this conference was given by Lord Rockingham, in a letter to Lord Albemarle, who, with Lord Gower and Mr. Rigby, were at Woburn with the Duke of Bedford. The letter was writ the same night, and received on Wednesday morning.
It was immediately shown, by Lord Rockingham's desire, to the Duke of Bedford, and concluded with a proposition from Lord Rockingham, to come down to Woburn, if the Duke of Bedford and his friends were disposed to act with them in Administration. The answer given was, that the Duke of Bedford and Mr. Grenville were one, and that he would not proceed without consulting me. The intended visit was, therefore, postponed 'till that was done, and Mr. Rigby proposed to go to London to know whether I was returned from the West, and to give Lord Rockingham the meeting, which he did accordingly that evening, and repeated to him their resolution not to do anything without me, and that they were determined not to be separated. In consequence of this, Mr. Rigby came hither on Friday, the 10th of this month, the day of my return home from the West, and from him I learnt the first intelligence of this negotiation. He assured me, in the strongest terms, of the Duke of Bedford's regard, and union with me both in system and in principles, and his own determination to cultivate it to the utmost. He said he had told Lord Rockingham, that neither the Duke of Bedford himself, nor he, as an individual, would ever depart from the ground we had taken, to assert and establish the entire sovereignty of Great Britain over our Colonies. That he was told in answer, that he, Lord Rockingham, declared for a wide and comprehensive system; but I do not know that anything either with regard to measures or men has been talked of in detail, nor is it certain to what degree Lord Rockingham is authorized. In this situation, after acknowledging the sense which I had of the behavior of the Duke of Bedford and his friends towards me, my answer was, that as to measures my opinions were well known, especially with regard to the capital one of asserting and establishing the sovereignty of Great Britain over America, in which I was happy to find that the Duke of Bedford and his friends so perfectly agreed with me; that as to arrangement of offices, as no message was sent to me I had no answer to give, nor, if there had, would I have given any answer without Lord Temple; that I entirely approved of a wide and comprehensive plan for an Administration, as the ability, strength, and authority which might thereby be given to it, would be the likeliest means to give it permanency, without which no system for the public good could be pursued; that upon these principles I should be extremely glad to see my friends honourably placed in the King's Government, and would cheerfully support an Administration formed upon them, but that I would do it out of office, and I insisted that my name should not be mentioned for any whatsoever. Mr. Rigby went to Woburn, on Saturday the 11th, to meet Lord Rockingham, and I went the same day to Stowe. On Sunday morning Mr. Rigby came over to us from Woburn, and told me that the Duke of Bedford and Lord Gower were extremely satisfied with my answer, to which Lord Temple agreed in every particular, and we both assured Mr. Rigby, that no factious or interested views of ours should stand in the way of any public settlement, which, if possible, we sincerely wished to see made upon those principles in which Mr. Rigby assured us that we all concurred. His language in both visits was as open and as amicable as could be. Upon the whole, my dear Lord, I really wish that my friends could be honourably placed in the King's Government upon principles which I neither can depart from myself or advise others to.
They might by that means be enabled to do some good, and I should be happy indeed, if by waving any pretensions of mine I could contribute to that great purpose instead of getting an office for myself, which would only give jealousy and umbrage, and could in the present moment be attended with no public benefit. I hope you will approve of what Lord Temple and I have said and done upon this occasion, and I trust that you will believe me when I earnestly beg of you to take no resolution contrary to it, out of your regard and kindness to me. Every motive as a public man makes me wish to see you honourably placed in Government, if that can be done, and you know me too well to think I would wish, much less propose it otherwise. What prospect there is that this negotiation will end as it ought to do, you will be able to judge as well as I can, from the account I have given you of all I know. The offer will only serve to weaken and incense if nothing is really intended, and instead of dividing will only unite. On the other hand, the conveying it through the Duke of Grafton and General Conway, and letting it rest there for six or seven days without Lord Rockingham's seeing the King, or hearing anything more of it, does not, according to the usual course of things, seem to promise much success, especially if it is true that on Friday last, during this interval, the King sent for Mr. Charles Townshend and had a conversation of an hour and a half with him, which Lord Rockingham knows nothing of. I have troubled you with this long letter that you may be fully apprised of all that has passed, and of my sentiments upon it, as far as I can form any in the present uncertain state; always wishing for your approbation and the continuance of that friendship from you with which I am, my dear Lord, &c, &c, George Grenville.
P.S. As some of the particulars of this letter are not fit for the post, I have desired Mr. Lloyd to carry it to town, and to inquire at your house for some safer and less public conveyance.
MR. GRENVILLE TO EARL TEMPLE
July 16, 1767
My dear Brother, � The intelligence you have transmitted to me from your London correspondents agrees exactly with my own opinion as to the sincerity of this transaction.
I have been convinced from the beginning that Lord Rockingham over-rated the powers supposed to be given to him by the message, and that the Duke of Grafton acted exactly the same part with Lord Gower and Lord Rockingham, with the same view of disuniting and getting some individuals.
The other speculations in your letters I am more doubtful of. For my own part, I have received no accounts whatever of what is going on since I saw you. If it is true that Lord Rockingham stated to Mr. Rigby that his powers were unlimited, "with the single exception of your Lordship and myself," we might have saved ourselves the trouble of insisting that we should not be named for any office, as that was done to our hands; but though this may seem ridiculous, our answers could only be according to what was stated to us.
We shall soon hear further; in the mean time, the ground which we have left it upon is solid, and in all respects the properest for us to stand upon. I send you back your letters with many thanks, and I am, &c, &c, George Grenville.
MR. GRENVILLE TO EARL TEMPLE
July 18, 1767
My dear Brother, � I send you enclosed the answers which I have given to Mr. Rigby's two notes, which I hope you will approve, and that you will think it right, in a matter of this delicate nature, to put into writing the answer which we both gave to him verbally at Stowe, especially as Lord Rockingham and the Duke of Bedford both refer to a plan agreed upon at Woburn, the particulars of which it is impossible that we should be yet thoroughly acquainted with.
I observe that the Duke of Grafton says repeatedly to Lord Rockingham that there would be great facility in the Court, if the negotiation were confined to his, Lord Rockingham's, and the Duke of Bedford's friends. What then are the articles of difficulty? You and I have insisted upon not being named for any office, nor have any of our friends been yet specifically mentioned either by us or to us. This, therefore, seems to me only a continuance of his Grace's jockey tricks, to endeavour to divide us, by persuading the Duke of Bedford's and Lord Rockingham's friends that they are sacrificed for us, which is the very reverse of the truth, and no notice is taken that we have insisted only upon measures, and that we have expressly declined being named for any office. This makes it necessary to be cautious, lest our true ground should be mistaken. I have the pleasure to tell you that all our friends whom I have heard from approve our conduct and answer, in the strongest terms.
Lord Suffolk came here from Wiltshire yesterday to dinner, and goes away this morning. Mr. Whately came in the evening from London, and brings me the same account of warm approbation from such of our friends as are in town. He talks of returning thither in a day or two, unless his longer stay would give him the pleasure of seeing you here, which we flatter ourselves will be the case, as I understood you proposed coming with our Eastbury guests about this time. I sincerely wish you would, as it is certainly better that we should be together when the denouement of this farce appears, which I think is not far off. Lord Suffolk, Mr. Whately, and all the inhabitants of Wotton, salute the inhabitants of Stowe most kindly. I am, my dear Brother, &c, George Grenville.
I have heard from Mr. Augustus Hervey, that Lord Bristol has declared that he will not go to Ireland, and from other hands, that he has been with the King to resign, as Lord Chatham's authority is not to continue.
He will forthwith, through Mr.Righy, apprize his Grace of the result, without any observation at present.
MR. GRENVILLE TO MR. RIGBY
July 22, 1767
Dear Sir, � Your letter of yesterday and of this morning was delivered to me about half an hour ago, and I immediately communicated it to Lord Temple, who is here with me.
The part which the Duke of Bedford and you have taken in your two meetings at the Duke of Newcastle's, so exactly tallies with the conduct and declarations which you have adhered to from the very beginning of this negotiation, that Lord Temple and I, who have so strongly approved of the former, must give our warmest testimony to what has now passed, and express the highest sense of the dignity, temper, and firmness with which the Duke of Bedford and his friends have behaved during the whole course of it. We must and do sincerely wish, for the sake of the public, that your plan, which was to have given efficacy, authority, and permanency to Administration, had taken effect; but with these sentiments it was impossible. What is to follow this I cannot foresee, for if Lord Rockingham, supported by the Duke of Bedford and his friends, and by all who approved the principles on which his Grace acted, was scarcely sufficient to make the last Ministry agree that their Administration was at an end, he must, I think, reduce all his demands very considerably, if under the present circumstances he hopes to succeed in any. What is the opinion of Lord Rockingham's friends upon this extraordinary proposal of putting Mr. Conway into the first office of Government after himself? Do they think this the comprehensive plan? You do not tell us what the Duke of Newcastle said to it. Surely it was unnecessary to press the Duke of Bedford to a second meeting, if he knew this was to be the issue of it; but there would be no end to comments and questions upon this extraordinary occasion. I therefore hasten to a much clearer and more agreeable topic, which is to return to the Duke of Bedford and you Lord Temple's best thanks and mine for everything you have said and done in the course of this business with regard to us, which instead of dividing us, the purpose probably for which the plan of delusion was set on foot, has only served to cement our union if possible still more strongly, and add to that affectionate regard with which I am, &c, &c, George Grenville.
P.S. I assure you that we have drunk the health of the Duke of Bedford and his friends in a bumper in the Claremont style, with our earnest wishes to have had you here had it been possible.
MR. GRENVILLE TO MR. WHATELY
July 30, 1767
Dear Whately, � I am glad that you have sent my letters to Lord George Sackville and to Lord Mansfield. I will talk to you of what you mention of the former when I have the pleasure of seeing you. Your conversation with Lord Mansfield will probably be over before this can reach you. I will only say, therefore, that I wish to leave him as fully informed as may be; and I think no part of this transaction can in its nature be a secret after the whole of it has been intrusted to such a variety of persons of different parties and situations. I approve of the communications you have made of the particulars of it, and especially to Sir F. Norton and to Mr. Wedderburn. The language holden by the latter, in his conference with Lord Bute, is in all respects so friendly to me that I beg you will assure him of my kindest thanks for it, and that I am much obliged to him for the justice he has done me in declaring my sentiments, that I would never suffer myself to be forced or obtruded upon the King. This has long been my resolution, and I have made no secret of it to anybody.
When the Duke of Bedford and I met Lord Bute at Lord Eglintoun's, the winter before last, it was the only declaration I then made, except what related to the repeal of the Stamp Act, the measure then depending. I am glad that Lord Bute does justice to Lord Temple's opinions and mine upon the present occasion; and I trust, whatever changes may happen in the various systems of parties and of politics, that Lord Temple and I shall always be found on that public ground upon which the honour and safety of the King and of his people equally depend. I agree with you in thinking, from the whole tenor of Lord Bute's conduct and conversation, that he will not appear in any transaction. As to what may be intended, the accounts are so contradictory that I can form no judgment of them; nor do I see the clue which is to extricate the King from the perplexities and difficulties in which His Majesty, and through him the kingdom, is unhappily involved. Any plan formed for that purpose shall certainly have my warmest wishes for its success, but what prospect there is of such a plan I am sure I know not. I will take no notice of the information you have given to me of what passed between Lord Bute and Mr. Wedderburn, except to Lord Temple, from whom I take it for granted nothing in which my name and ideas are mentioned is intended to be concealed. I agree with you in thinking it probable that nothing might be meant by Lord Bute in that conversation except expressions of civility, and to show his friendship for Mr. Wedderburn, in return for the very honourable part which Mr. Wedderburn took towards him personally in the course of last Session of Parliament. I am, &c, &c George Grenville.
R. GRENVILLE TO THE EARL OF MANSFIELD
August 5, 1767
My dear Lord, � Your letter of the 31st of last month gave me the highest satisfaction which I could propose to myself from the late negotiation, by informing me that you so kindly approved the conduct of Lord Temple and myself in the course of it; and I should not have delayed from the 2nd of this month, when I received it, 'till now, to return you my sincerest thanks for every part of it, if Mr. Whately had not informed me that you was set out upon the Home Circuit, and would not return to your own house 'till the end of the week. My thoughts agree so perfectly with yours as to the other parts of this transaction, that it would only be giving you unnecessary trouble to repeat them.
I am extremely obliged to you, my dear Lord, for the wish you expressed to have copies of the papers which Mr. Whately showed you by my desire, and likewise of my letter to Lord Suffolk The former, Mr. Whately says he would send to you before this time, and enclosed I transmit to you a copy of the latter, and shall be very happy to give you any further information of what has passed, if there is anything which has not yet come to your knowledge; feeling, as I do most sensibly, those friendly motives which have indued you to be troubled with them, and knowing that if they were far more secret than from the nature of them they can be, there is no man to whose judgment and to whose affection I would more gladly entrust them. It cannot but appear, therefore, very natural to the world, who are no strangers to the respect I bear to your opinions, and to the sense I have of your friendship, that I should take the earliest opportunity to acquaint you with all circumstances in which my public life and character are concerned. As to the present state of things, the melancholy picture which you draw of it at the end of your letter, is too striking and too true. The cure must come from a serious conviction and right measures, instead of annual struggles for places and pensions, and that cure ought not to be delayed. Private resentments should mix as little as may be with public opinions. In the last negotiation, Lord Temple and I have stood entirely upon the latter, and upon that ground I trust WB shall continue, being convinced that the situation grows hourly too critical and dangerous to indulge other passions. This is the only clue to lead us through the present maze of politics, to the King's honour and happiness, and consequently to the public safety. This is, I am sure, the likeliest means for me to obtain your good opinion, which, both as a public and as a private man, I shall ever be most anxious to preserve, from the sincere respect and regard with which I am, my dear Lord, &c, &c George Grenville.
MR. GRENVILLE TO MR. WHATELY
October 20, 1767
Dear Whately, � I know no kind of political news, except a confirmation of the uneasiness and discontent with which Lord Townshend set forward for his new government of Ireland, where it is most likely that he will meet with many circumstances to increase both, instead of lessening either. The account of the Cabinet Council meeting to settle the business of that kingdom being put off, first for a match at Newmarket, and secondly, because the Duke of Grafton had company in his house, exhibits a lively picture of the present Administration on the one hand, and on the other, of the supineness and indifference of the good people of England, from whence the Ministry seems to have copied it, as the means of being popular, by adapting themselves to the genius of the nation; and I will venture to prophesy, that the first will never be effectually changed till the latter is. As to any other change merely of persons, you know my opinion, that it is not worth the contest.
Nothing but a serious conviction of the evils we labour under, in the minds both of the King and the people, can in any degree operate a cure; and 'till that is effected, at least in one of the two, I own I see no prospect of any public benefit, though a very fair one for private emolument from the present disgraceful and uncertain state. Distresses of many kinds will, if I mistake not, open their eyes at last. The best wish I can form is, that it may not be too late to apply any remedy. I hear that the Duke of Bedford is at Woburn, in better spirits than he has been with regard to his blindness, from the hopes which have been given to him that he may soon be in a condition to be couched. I shall be glad to do any good offices in my power to Mr. D'Oyly wherever an occasion offers. I am, &c, &c George Grenville.
MR. GRENVILLE TO LORD TREVOR
December 31, 1767
My dear Lord, � No information which your letter could convey to me concerning our present political state could give me so much pleasure as your kind attention in writing to me.
I have indeed heard very little news since I came hither, but I was informed authentically of the intended alterations the day before I left London, and was then told that Mr. Conway wished to keep the Seals 'till after the adjournment, that it might not look as if he was turned out. It was not then, I believe, understood that he meant to keep them 'till the end of the Sessions, nor did I hear of Mr. Rigby's refusal to kiss hands for his employment 'till Mr. Conway had actually resigned both his office and the lead in the House of Commons. I should think the latter very difficult to be retained without the former, but whatever the merits of the dispute may be, the decision of it, if it has arisen, will certainly be significant in the present situation. I shall be curious to know what system is to be adopted for Ireland and America; whether the new Secretary of State for the Colonies will be reconciled to the ideas of their dependence and obedience, agreeably to the letter and intention of the British Acts of Parliament, or whether their independence is to be openly avowed: if the former is determined upon, a firm and temperate conduct must be steadily pursued; if the latter, appearances of resentment against the Americans, which you suspect, will only expose the honour of the King and kingdom to fresh insults and contempt.
I am sorry for the very indifferent account you give of the Duke of Newcastle's illness, because I think that his influence with his friends has of late been well employed.
I am very sorry for my poor old friend the late Speaker; a mortification in the leg at his time of life seems indeed very desperate. He has lived, however, long enough to have the additional mortification of out-living the credit and dignity of that House which had been the great object of his life, and which he had supported with so much reputation. I am ever, &c, &c George Grenville.
MR. GRENVILLE TO MR. WIHATELY
April 13, 1768
Dear Whately, � I do not see how the conduct of the Assembly of New York, in giving a sum of money to the Crown, but refusing to take the least notice of the Mutiny Act, can be called a submission to that law, or represented as a discouragement to the popular opinions of America not being bound by our laws. It seems to me the very reverse; but I have done with talking to the deaf: they must feel before they believe, and I think that period of conviction is not far off.
If different factions prevail in the management of the East India Company's affairs abroad, as much as they seem to do in their general courts at home, the former will lay them open even to a weak attack in India, as the latter will infallibly do to the weakest Administration at a very inflammatory speech in reply, denouncing in no measured terms the usurpation of the rights of the people by their own representatives, concluding with the following oath of abjuration. Whereupon he kissed the bottle.
Through the friendship of Lord Clive to Mr. Grenville, and at the recommendation of the latter, Wedderburn was elected for Bishop's Castle in November following. While he was out of Parliament he went about making harangues, and supporting violent resolutions against the Government, and he was more a Wilkite than even Wilkes himself.
Wedderburn acquired a considerable fortune by his marriage in December, 1767, with the daughter and sole heir of John Dawson, Esq.,of Morley in Yorkshire, from whence this letter is dated. Lord Campbell's biography of Wedderburn, in his Lives of the Chancellors, is written in his usual comprehensive style. I have been frequently indebted to that amusing work, in which, however, an accurate observer will perhaps detect too many allusions to the personal and party feelings of our own times.
I am glad you have seen Mr. Walsh and Mr. Strachey, and that you approve so much of their cause. I hear that Mr. Wilkes has met with a very mortifying reception at Bath, being universally avoided by all degrees of men. If this account be true, it may possibly have given courage to our Ministers to hold, as I am told they do, a higher language at this moment. I will, however, foretell, without the gift of prophecy, that this language will be exactly similar to what has been holden out about America, and fall again under low-water mark on the appearance of any difficulty, or any disapprobation from the mob. For my own part, I agree with our friend Mr. Wedderburn, that the populace of London have a better right to give the law to the King and the Government of Great Britain, than the populace of Boston, and I can hardly believe that those who tremble at the latter will be bold enough to encounter the former. I should not wonder if what you tell me of Sir William Beauchamp Proctor's audience should be true; and yet if it were, I should not draw any consequence from it. I am, &c George Grenville.
MR. GRENVILLE TO MR. WHATELY
September 18, 1768
Dear Sir, � Your two last letters of the 13th and 15th of this month were brought over to me to Stowe, to which place we went on Wednesday last, by my bro ther's desire, to be present at the reception of the King of Denmark, who came thither, according to his appointment, on Friday morning to breakfast. We afterwards walked out, and attended him all round the Gardens. Dinner was ordered, by his directions, to be ready a little before one, and, between three and four in the evening, he set out on his return to London, where he was to be that night. He was extremely gracious, and seemed to be very much pleased with the place, and with all the marks of attention and respect shown to him; and, indeed, my brother omitted nothing which could contribute to make his reception agreeable and convenient to him. There were nine other gentlemen who attended him, and dined with us; amongst others, his Minister, Count Bernstorff, and Count Holcke, who came with his Danish Majesty in the same chaise, and is said to be his favourite. I had a great deal of conversation both with the one and the other, and I thought they behaved extremely well. I understand that the King of Denmark leaves this country on the 7th of October, and then goes to France. I sincerely wish that he may have taken a favourable impression of the manner in which he has been received here in general, and am very sorry to see, by your letter, that any part of the behavior towards him should be thought deficient, and liable to censure, especially if it is in the Government itself, where it must be of most importance.
I have received from America the same account with that which you sent to me, of the state of things there, which is the natural and certain consequence of what has been done here. I have nothing new to say to you upon that subject. You know my opinions, which every day confirms me in. I believe no plan of operations is yet formed, though I am assured that all the Administration except Lord Shelburne (who must soon withdraw) are agreed upon coercive measures; what those measures are to be, we shall see, I suppose, when the Parliament meets, and not till then. If the petition, which you mention to be preparing by the Americans here, against the dissolution of their Assemblies, goes on, that will probably be presented about the meeting of the Parliament, and will furnish matter of debate immediately, especially if it shall be true, as you have been informed, that the idea of the present Ministry is, that the Crown and not the Parliament is the proper authority to reduce the colonies to obedience. I am, &c, &c George Grenville.
MR. GRENVILLE TO THE EARL OF SUFFOLK
November 25, 1768
My dear Lord, � You will, probably, before this letter reaches you, have heard of an event relative to Lord Temple, in which I am so nearly interested from the affection which I bear to him, and from many other motives, that you will be glad, I am persuaded, to know the circumstances from myself rather than from any other report. Lord Temple came to me the day before yesterday, and with the kindest and warmest expressions towards me, told me that he intended to go to Lord and Lady Chatham, at Hayes, either as yesterday or to-day, in consequence of some overtures which had been made
to him for that purpose.
He said that as the political differences between him and Lord Chatham, he had reason to believe, were in a great degree over, and as his desires not to hang out false colours upon that subject had been a principal motive with him to break off all intercourse, not only with him but with his sister, Lady Chatham, who had always behaved well to him, the affection which he bore to her now induced him to renew it when that obstacle was removed. He assured me in the strongest terms that his public opinions continued, and would always continue, the same; and that his friendship and affection towards me was, and should ever be, unalterable, and that nothing should divide us. My answer to him, after acknowledging and joining with him in those sentiments of brotherly love which he so warmly expressed and I so sensibly felt, was, that it would ill become me in my situation, and at my time of life, to use any argument to prevent his being reconciled to my sister, Lady Chatham, whenever his own opinion or inclinations led him to it; that I was extremely happy in the strong assurances that he gave me, that this change of situation should make no alteration in his public opinions, nor in the inviolable affection which we had borne to each other ever since our union a few years ago. He expressed himself in the most affectionate terms with regard to the manner in which I received this communication, and repeated to me what he had told me before; and that he had determined to take no step in it till he had acquainted me with it, nor would he do so in the course of it if it went any further.
These are the outlines of what passed between us.
Many comments may possibly be made upon this event at this time, especially as men's thoughts and conjectures travel much faster than human actions can bear pace with, and run to the end of the journey almost before it is begun. I can truly assure you, that I know of no state mystery in this transaction beyond what all the world must see in this time of universal confusion and distraction. I am, &c, &c George Grenville.
