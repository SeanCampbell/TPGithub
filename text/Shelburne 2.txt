Though I was very much ashamed to have troubled you lately upon such an ill-grounded tale, it is not through an apprehension of my having lost any degree of your attention by it, that makes me rather write than wait upon you, to tell you the particulars of a conversation I had yesterday at the French Minister�s with Lord Rockingham, very much at his desire; which upon consideration since was so distinct, and had so much the appearance of premeditation, that it certainly must have been intended to be communicated directly to you, or else that, as from myself, it should make part of the first conversation you honoured me with, which I look upon as the same thing. But as I neither gave any opinion, and do profess myself totally unable to form any, and nothing passed which makes it necessary for me to renew the conversation, I think this way of communicating it may be more convenient, than desiring to wait upon you.
Lord Rockingham said he intended waiting on you on Saturday but was prevented; that the time was now come, or coming very soon, when something settled was to be formed, if ever, without regard to the Duke of Bedford�s party on the one hand, or Lord Bute�s on the other; but that he was glad of an opportunity to tell me where he was under the greatest apprehensions it would hitch, and that all that he could do could not prevent it.
He then stated his own situation with regard to some individuals whom though his opinion led him to be almost sure Mr. Pitt would not treat with harshness in new casting the system �- and was it only himself that was in question, it could not meet with a moment�s doubt � yet he could not with any content of mind go into anything where they were to be left to what they might call uncertainty; that, in regard to the Duke of Newcastle and Mr. Yorke, though he had reason to believe they might be brought into everything that was desired, yet it was to be wished that it should be proposed with a certain degree of regard, and that manner might reconcile men�s minds to that which it would be impossible ever to force them to. 
I observed or at least thought he avoided saying whether the seals were to be Mr. Yorke�s object, but seemed carefully to adhere to such general terms upon Mr. Yorke�s subject, as I have mentioned. He then spoke of the consequence of offending them, perhaps unnecessarily, in point of numbers in the House of Commons, which I took the liberty of telling him, I could not think him serious in mentioning; but upon the whole came to this point : that from these reasons, as well as others regarding the King himself, who had always since the Duke�s death dwelt upon his not being given up blindfold, that he was certain when they came to go into the King, if nothing previous was settled, it would give His Majesty such advantage that everything would be given up without anything certain, and a convulsion would follow which might bring in the late Ministry, or no one knew what; while, if they went in united and in good humour with each other, the King was so hampered by many things that had passed, that without entering into any consideration of the interior of the Court he must certainly agree to it. He spoke a good deal of the Duke of Grafton with regard and friendship as a man, but not quite I thought as a Minister, with that cordiality I could wish. I plainly saw he was convinced the Duke of Grafton and Mr. Conway would bring things to a crisis. He said he had been told from those who had heard it from you, that they had asked more as your friends than he had done, at the same time that you could with great sincerity commend his motives. I told him with great truth that I had never heard any such distinction.
When he spoke of influence about the King I could not help saying something, though as I saw there was little hope of convincing, what I said was so guarded that it amounted to nothing; and as to the rest my aim was to leave it in general where I found it, answering him with great sincerity that I felt myself totally unable to form any judgment in the present confusion, that I could mention even in the greatest confidence to you. And I have only to beg, Sir, that you will not interpret my relation of the conversation into any opinion of my own, which is one among other reasons of my writing it. It is not only such a labyrinth, but a labyrinth so entangled that I have no faculties which lead me to any understanding of it, or any clue to direct the little judgment I have, and as to passions they have some time subsided in regard to it.
Though I believe I have been pretty exact in relating what Lord Rockingham said, yet as he did not expressly desire it to be communicated, I should be sorry that it made the foundation even of an opinion in your own mind, till you had it from better authority. Though he seemed to me to speak with a manner of decision, yet he may have meant it a manner of negociation which I may not understand. At any rate, I have many pardons to ask for troubling you with so long a letter, and in return I will only beg for a very short one either from you or Lady Chatham to tell me, I hope, that you are not the worse for sitting up so late in the House.
I have the honour to be,
Most respectfully yours,
SHELBURNE.
Soon after I came to town, the Chairman and Deputy Chairman came to me to speak about their accounts with the French for prisoners, which are still unpaid. They took occasion at the same time to enter into their general situation. They declared they did not think themselves authorized by the general Court to do more than to desire of the Administration certain powers which are wanted for the better regulation of the Company�s affairs in India, and to hear what Government may expect for them and for a new charter. Further they did not think themselves authorized to go, without fresh powers; and in their private opinions they did not see how that could be, till some authentic determination was come to, to decide the right; upon which it was well known there were different opinions, not only in the city, but in Parliament. This was their language to me, to which I returned a very general answer.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, whether that they had more confidence in him or that from a more intimate communication with them he was able to inspire them with his sentiments, has been uniform in believing they would come to Government, and with such a proposal as would be approved by Parliament. He has gone so far as to declare it as his opinion to the House; upon which the printing of the papers was stopped, and the stock rose. In the meantime the directors have said nothing, nor taken any step worth mentioning, and the matter stands there. Mr. Beckford is at a loss how to prosecute the inquiry in this situation, when the Committee meets on Friday. I take it for granted your Lordship will choose to explain yourself to the Duke of Grafton, in consequence� of what-ever may occur to you upon it; but it was impossible to write without mentioning the greatest point a nation ever had depending; and that is all I mean.
His Majesty, is extremely sorry to observe any degree of ill-temper remaining in his Colony of Massachusetts Bay, or that points should be so improperly agitated as to tend to the revival of disputes which every friend to America must wish to be forgotten. They have seen the Parliament of Great Britain give due attention to all well-founded complaints of the Provinces, notwithstanding they appeared to them in some parts not so properly urged. Though the Legislature will certainly on all just occasions exercise and enforce its Legislative power over the Colonies, yet it cannot be doubted but it will exert it with a due regard to the nature of their connection with the mother-country.
Upon this occasion it is proper to observe in general that the ease and honour of His Majesty�s government in America will greatly depend on the temper and wisdom of those who are entrusted with the Administration there, and that they ought to be persons disdaining narrow views, private combination, and partial attachments. A temperate conduct founded on the true basis of public good, avoiding all unnecessary reserve where nothing arbitrary is thought of, nothing unreasonable required, must carry conviction to the hearts of the deluded, conciliate the minds of all, and insure the confidence of His Majesty�s loyal and loving subjects of America.
Upon these considerations I am persuaded that the Assembly will immediately upon their meeting fall upon measures to terminate all local difficulties, which appear by your accounts to have hitherto prevented that compliance expected by Parliament with the recommendations you have been required to make, in consequence of the resolutions of both Houses. It is impossible to conceive that they will suffer any private considerations to interfere with their desire of showing a proper sense of that paternal regard which they have experienced from His Majesty, and of that attention which Parliament has given to their complaints, which can never be done with more propriety than by granting with the utmost cheerfulness a just compensation to those who have suffered by the late disorders.
I write to acquaint you, of three very material points, which are thought to require the deliberation of the King�s servants in order to their being laid before him.
1st. A proper system for the management of the Indians, and for the carrying on the commerce with them on the most advantageous footing.
2nd. The most eligible manner of disposing of the troops; as well for convenience as for offence and defence.
3rd. A reduction of the contingent expenses of the establishment in North America, and the raising an American fund to defray American expenses in part or in whole.
As so much depends upon the happy regulation of these different articles, they require to be well weighed before a final resolution can be taken upon them, and as the King is desirous that they shall be regulated with all the dispatch that is consistent with securing both the permanence and honor of his Government, and the prosperity of his American subjects, every light and information which can be added to those we are already possessed of will be duly attended to.
You will therefore pay the utmost attention to these three points, and from time to time transmit such information and refiections upon them as shall occur to you.
In regard of the first article, that of the Indian affairs, a plan formed some time ago has been under deliberation. As this plan was transmitted to all the governors in North America for their opinions, it must have fallen within your observation. Many articles in it however appearing not so well calculated for the end proposed as could be wished, and several others being rather detrimental to it, there is a necessity either of reforming it, or of substituting another in its place. But it is to me matter of doubt whether any method of managing Indians can be found preferable to that of leaving the trade of each province to the particular care of that province, under some general rules and restrictions to which all the provinces must be subject in general.
A plan drawn up by Lord Barrington has been some time under consideration for quartering the troops. This matter will be fully discussed here, but as it is possible that in the end His Majesty may leave it in great measure to your prudence and judgment, you will lose no time to consider this point fully. In the meantime it is His Majesty�s desire, that in any changes of the present disposition you have occasion to make, regard be had to make the military as little burdensome to the inhabitants as possible, by disposing them preferably among the young colonies, where in many respects they must be considered as advantageous, rather than in His Majesty�s more settled colonies, except where they are desired, or in your opinion wanted.
The third article is that of the greatest consequence, and therefore merits the most particular and mature consideration. 
The forming an American fund to support the exigencies of Government in the same manner as is done in Ireland, is what is so highly reasonable that it must take place sooner or later. The most obvious manner of laying a foundation for such a fund seems to be by taking proper care of the quit-rents, and by turning the grants of lands to real benefit, which might tend to increase rather than diminish the powers of Government in so distant a country.
You must be sensible that very great abuses have taken place in both respects which cry aloud for redress. Proper regulations for these purposes might be a means of preventing Indian disturbances in future, which now in great measure arise from individuals possessing themselves of their lands without the knowledge of Government.
It is far however from His Majesty�s intention that any rigour should be exercised in respect of quit-rents long due, but nothing can be more reasonable than that the proprietors of large tracts of land (which ought by the terms of the respective grants to have been cultivated long since) should either pay their quit-rents punctually for the time to come, or relinquish their grant in favour of those who will.
As to the manner of making out grants of land for the future, I could wish to have the best information possible, so that such a system might be adopted for that purpose, particularly in the new and conquered Provinces, as would at the same time serve to promote the good of the Colonies, and lighten the burden which lies upon the mother-country.
Although the reduction of expense in America is a very necessary point, yet I must do the Treasury the justice to say, that they do not wish to retrench any expense which can contribute to the advantage of the country or the good of the service; on the contrary, the intention is that no expense shall be spared which is really useful, but that none shall be incurred which is not so. And indeed it is hardly possible that many articles of expense very necessary at the time, which the exigencies of the war required to be entered into without delay, should not now require reformation and admit of being retrenched. But this desirable point can only be effected by a thorough digest and judicious arrangement of the different departments in America.
You cannot therefore be too full in giving your own thoughts upon these matters, nor in procuring the very best intelligence possible from your correspondents in all the Provinces to be transmitted to me from time to time also.
In regard to America, the enclosed minute from the House of Commons will show your Lordship Mr. Grenville�s question. Mr. Townshend answered him, but agreed as to the principle of the Stamp Act and the duty itself; only the heats which prevailed made it an improper time to press it; and treating the distinction between external and internal taxes as ridiculous in everybody�s opinion except the Americans, pledged himself in short to the House to find a revenue, if not adequate (a word Lord George Sackville pressed him with, with a view to pin him down as much as possible), yet nearly sufficient to answer the expense, when properly reduced. What he means, I do not conceive. I have always thought the quit-rents may be so managed, without having too great a retrospect, as to produce a certain sum; and I have likewise had reason to think that such a new method of granting lands might be devised as might give infinite satisfaction to America, contribute to the ascertaining property by preventing future suits at law, in great measure prevent the Indian disturbances, and besides all this incidentally produce a certain revenue, without its being the object; but I do not conceive either of them can possibly take place this year, there not being materials in any office here sufficient to form a final judgment of them. Many of them must come for that purpose from America.
I have heard, indeed, from general conversation, that Mr. Townshend has a plan for establishing a board of customs in America, and by a new regulation of the tea duty here, and some other alterations, to produce a revenue on imports there. I am myself in no respect able to form a judgment how far this
may be likely to answer the end or no; but in many views it appears a matter that will require the deepest consideration, at this time especially. Besides I believe your Lordship will think the speech I have just mentioned to you is not the way to make any thing go down well in North America.
I thought it necessary to inform your Lordship thus far of the state of American affairs here, before I came to speak of the actual state of them there. They have universally agreed to the compensation required by Parliament to be made to the sufferers. My letter upon that subject, in Massachusetts Bay has undergone a very free discussion; but they have fully agreed, and the Assembly have written me a letter, which I enclose to your Lordship. The governor writes short, but inveighing in general terms against the people. -
A petition is at the same time come from New York, signed by two hundred and forty persons, to the House of Commons, and sent to the Board of Trade to present ; 1 who have transmitted it to me, to know the King�s pleasure upon it. I likewise find that when the last ships came away the Assembly had my letter under consideration; which your Lordship may remember was written after a Council, upon Sir Henry Moore�s and General Gage�s accounts of the difficulty made by the Assembly to provide the troops with vinegar and other articles, which Sir Jeffery Amherst�s letters assure him they will not comply with, lest they should admit what might hereafter be deemed a precedent for a Tax Act.
I have only told the merchants in general that it was well known some of those who opposed the Stamp Act opposed it upon very extensive principles with regard to American trade, upon a supposition that the advantages of it must finally centre with the mother-country; that these objects could never be considered separate: to consider them together required not only great judgment and great power, but temper too; leaving it to them to judge how very imprudently the present moment was chosen, when on the one hand they saw how far the prejudices about the Stamp Act still prevailed, and on the other an assembly imprudent enough to hesitate about obeying an Act of Parliament in its full extent, after the tenderness which had been shown America; not to mention their manner of sending it over. The merchants and the Americans here seem sensible of its being the height of imprudence, and are sorry; but your Lordship may easily conceive it has occasioned a number of reports, and is likely, in the talk of the town, to undergo the imputation of rebellion, and will probably be mentioned as such by Mr. Grenville in the House of Commons without seeing it.
The King�s commands, and the importance of whatever determination is taken in regard to America, must excuse me to your Lordship for breaking in upon you, when I know your intention is to be in town if well enough; if not, that the same reason which detains you, may make business altogether inconvenient. In the last case I hope you will make no scruple to lay aside my letter. It is the general opinion that the present packet should not go to America without some determination of government after the imprudent conduct of New York, as well on account of appearance here, as effect there. I have therefore stopped its sailing in order to submit my own thoughts to your Lordship, before I execute the rest of the King�s commands by laying it before the rest of his servants. I wish I could at the same time acquaint you with the opinions of the other ministers, but though everybody is strongly for enforcing, nobody chooses to suggest the mode. I presumed to ask the King whether any occurred to His Majesty, but I could not find that any had, except that it should be enforced. Enclosed I send your Lordship all that I have received from Lord Barrington; which contains a general account of the Act. It was first suggested by the military, and intended to give a power of billeting on private houses, as was done in the war. It was altered by the merchants and agents, who substituted empty houses, provincial barracks, and barns, in their room, undertaking that the Assembly should supply them with the additional necessaries; and it passed, I believe, without that superintendence or attention on the part of Government, which is so wanted in all cases where necessity requires something different from the general principles of the constitution. I am told it was carried through by Mr. Ellis, without the entire conviction or cordial support of Mr. Grenville, who made it a separate Bill lest it might embarrass the General Mutiny Act.
The infatuated conduct of the Assembly in refusing even present obedience to the Act, precludes I am afraid all consideration of the merits or principles of it, by involving a far greater question. I have, however, examined with all the attention possible the Mutiny Act here, and find it amazingly tender both in regard to Scotland and Ireland. That part of it only which regards the discipline extends to Ireland. It is very extraordinary that by the best information I have been able to procure, the troops are quartered there under no direct law whatever here or there, but either on account of old prerogative or custom, or the necessity of the thing being understood, it is generally submitted to.
As things stand in America, so many considerations cross upon each other, that all the difficulties of the situation are scarce within compass to be stated. One great difficulty, however, is, that whatever the conduct of New York or even of America may be, arising from the diffidence and excess of apprehension your Lordship mentions, it were to be wished not to establish a precedent in whatever is done, which may hereafter be turned to purposes of oppression and to promote measures opposite to those general public principles upon which the Stamp Act was repealed. Another is that if these infatuated people should be tempted to resist in the last instance, which there is the greatest reason to apprehend from the Governor�s letter and their address, I think it too plain from the accounts we daily receive that France and Spain would no longer defer breaking a peace, the days of which they already begin to count, though I profess and very sincerely feel the want of that experience and sagacity necessary to form any judgment of the intentions of foreign Powers.
Your Lordship will have received the Duke of Grafton�s letter with an account of the present state of the Indian business, which I am extremely glad to find meets your Lordship�s intention. His Grace, I take it for granted, has enclosed to you the minute of Cabinet, stating their proposal as it stands being unintelligible, with several queries, upon which they were desired to explain themselves. The Duke of Grafton has since seen the Chairman and Deputy Chairman; who said they were infinitely obliged to every Lord of the Cabinet for not commanding their attendance, as they must have been silent. They desired for that reason to put the paper of queries in their pocket, without reading it till they got to the India House, where they would prepare the answer, but were afraid it was impossible to do it so soon as Friday; which leaves it open to Mr. Beckford to state himself as ready, which I understand he is, to go into the inquiry, having delayed it hitherto more out of candour to Mr. Townshend�s declaration than his own opinion, which has always been that it could not be transacted out of Parliament, and will give Mr. Townshend and Mr. Conway an opportunity in answer, to state the matter as it is: that there has been a proposal, which, not being sufficiently clear to lay before Parliament, has been returned to the directors for further explanation upon it, which they have promised to give, but has not yet been received. The consequence I suppose must be further adjournment for at least a week longer. If this meets your Lordship�s idea, I will take care to give it all possible attention, and will make it my business to see Mr. Beckford upon it, and that it shall be properly understood. If it does not, I beg your Lordship to let me have your further commands any time to-morrow. I am sure I need not endeavour to express to your Lordship my concern for the occasion of your delay, or for the inconvenient situation I am afraid you find yourself in.
Notwithstanding the great defects in the constitutions of the American Provinces, they acknowledged and practised a due obedience to the laws of the British Legislature until the enacting of the late Stamp Act.
The progression of affairs in America had not yet led the thoughts of men to independence. They were obedient from habit, and from that reverence with which they considered the mother-country ; but the Stamp Act having an immediate tendency to destroy the whole frame of their constitutions, by taking away from their Legislatures the only subjects of taxation which the laws of trade and navigation had left them, it was no wonder therefore if they thought of self-defence and resistance, that their habits of obedience were broken, and their reverence towards this country diminished.
The feelings of mankind are generally more to be depended upon than their understandings. In England,
the Stamp Act was a speculative point, but in America, the meanest settler felt his freedom and his property to depend on the event.
It is clear that the British Government ought to have enforced that Act with its whole power, or to have acknowledged its error with ingenuousness and candour, which would have showed a frankness and condescension which must have been interpreted into true dignity; but unhappily the British Parliament did neither. It affirmed its own right of enacting, whilst it repealed the Act itself in visible complaisance to the clamour of America, and thereby naturally suggested to the Provinces, that the timidity of the British Parliament kept pace with its ill dispositions towards them.
To the law declarative of the right of the British Parliament, were added resolutions that the sufferers by the riots in America ought to be compensated by the American Assemblies. The first served to excite ill- humour; the last furnished a subject for the exercise of it; and the whole together gave occasions to turbulent and seditious men, to infiame for their own purposes the disorders of America; and by promoting indecent resolutions and suggesting improper words and expressions, they seem successfully to have laid a ground for more resentments here, and consequently for more fears, doubts, and animosities in America.
To these misfortunes has been added the Mutiny Act, which strangely enacts that the American Assemblies shall enact that certain Articles be provided for the Troops in barracks there. The whole amount of those Articles is I suppose a mere trifie, not worth the contending for; but it is a question of real importance to America, Whether their Assemblies are obliged to enact implicitly points concerning which all debate is precluded, and whether the Parliament of Great Britain can thus effectually tax America internally through the medium of their own Assemblies, without leaving those Assemblies any choice in the matter, except as to the mode only in which the money shall be raised. It seems also very hard that this provision should be made for an indefinite number of troops, which may occasionally load particular provinces beyond their power to support; nor is the end to be obtained, likely to conciliate the Americans to the means. A military establishment there, is what they so little desire or need, that they look upon it on the contrary with the most jealous and fearful eye.
The Mutiny Act is likely to renew the animosities, and perhaps the tumults in America. It has already occasioned such resolutions of the Assemblies there, as may be considered derogatory of the dignity of Great Britain, so that this Act is likely to produce two questions at home, one concerning its own propriety, and the other concerning the dignity of Great Britain, which is committed in the support of it.
Besides this succession of impolitic measures, there has been doubtless much want of wisdom and management in His Majesty�s Governors in America. Mr. Bernard in particular, after having governed the Province of Massachusetts Bay for many years with words only, felt very naturally a wish in the beginning of the present troubles to muster up his arguments and chop logic with the General Assembly, and though he has been foiled at his own weapons, he seems to this day to value himself more upon a good argument than a wise measure; but seeing at present the ill-success of this proceeding, and that the clamour is too loud for argument, he seems to have retired to his closet to vent his chagrin in womanish complaints, instead of combining men, and forming such bold plans of administration as the exigence of affairs seems to require, and as his situation, invested as he is with the authority of Great Britain, might well enable him to do.
I cannot be so near Hayes, without communicating to your Ladyship from London an event of a personal nature. It is General Conway�s resigning the emoluments of his office as Secretary of State, on account of certain delicacies he felt for what passed last summer in regard to Lord Rockingham. It has been some time in agitation, but was not communicated to me, till General Conway mentioned it, at the moment the Duke of Grafton was gone in to the King to acquaint His Majesty finally of his resolution. I must own, when it was first told me, I felt it an agreeable opening for me to do the same; and that I might by that means be freed from various delicacies, and some uneasiness in a situation in which Lord Chatham placed me, and which without his approbation I did not think myself at liberty to desert. Upon weighing it, however, I must own I saw as many objections, and what concluded me to defer such a step was, that I thought it wrong to do a thing which, however rightly intended, might have the air of experiment, without Lord Chatham�s example or concurrence.
I know not how to make your Ladyship sufficient excuses for troubling you upon any subject of business; I am afraid it is not a sufficient one, to say it is an ease to my own mind to acquaint your Ladyship of it, so that if Lord Chatham should chance to hear of it, you might have the goodness to acquaint him of the motives of my conduct.
As for the course of public affairs, what regards Parliament I conceive may, with common management, be carried through without difficulty. As for the Court, Lord Chatham knows my opinion, as it has been unvaried since I first waited upon him at Northend. As to foreign affairs, there are many accounts which certainly do not flatter the almost universal wish of peace; but if there should any certainty come of any such great event as a war, I shall presume to acquaint your Ladyship of it, without troubling you with too many particulars. In the meantime, I have every reason to believe nothing can so effectually keep it off as the report of Lord Chatham�s health.
Your Grace knows so very well my motives of engaging in and continuing in this system, that I need not repeat them. As to what passed in August, I am a total stranger to it, which may not be surprising, as, since Lord Chatham�s illness, I have not heard the least of what has been carrying on or projected, except the business that occurred necessarily in the course of my own office, nor had I the least idea till this moment that any change respecting the Southern Department was ever in the least agitation or thought of by your Grace. As to what you mention, I have not the least objection to talking to you upon it, whenever your Grace thinks proper, as I presume this is not a proper place for it, there being so many people waiting in the next room. Your Grace will only give me leave to ask you for curiosity whether any American event has given rise to this new opinion of your Grace�s, for I presume it is so far new as to have been conceived since the forming of the present administration, else if your Grace had possessed it then so strongly, you would certainly have urged it at that time as by far the properest.
As to that particular, it was certainly very wrong, but it was the affair of an Under Secretary and not mine, and I did suppose must be owing to some accident of supposing his Grace to be in the country, which sometimes happened, as they were in general very punctual, but I am vastly happy that no real evil has happened to the King�s affairs or those of the public, which I had the care if in that quarter of the world, but that it had been reduced in the main to some degree of order and obedience also to Parliamentary authority, from a very different state in which I found i; a degree of success which I could not attribute to my own ability but to good luck alone. As to the rest I cannot help observing frankly to his Grace, that had I been where his Grace is, and the Secretary, and supposing me to have the same opinion with his Grace, that I should most certainly have chosen to have communicated it frankly to the person whom it regarded, rather then to those several other persons whom his Grace mentioned, or at least have avowed and communicated it at the same time. I will not detain your Grace longer at present, but will be ready to talk further to your Grace whenever you think proper and whenever you please.
I had a long conversation after the Cabinet, with the Count du Ch�telet, With a view to discover if possible the motives of such a step. But hitherto his instructions do not appear to go beyond the arguments which have been already used to your Excellency, such IS the right both France and Genoa have to conclude a Treaty between themselves as independent States, without the intervention of any other Power; the little value of Corsica in itself, its importance to France alone from its vicinity, the openness of the whole proceeding on the part of France, and in fine the good intentions of France in
general, as well as the particular disposition of the King, the interest of the present Ministers and the desire of the whole people to preserve the public tranquility: the answers to which are so obvious and self-evident, that l have no doubt of your Excellency�s having repeatedly urged them, it being clear that whatever right States may have to conclude Treaties amongst each other, it must be with a due regard to the obligations they have entered into by former Treaties, and if none of the powers concerned have claimed to exercise the guaranty of such Treaties, it furnishes still further ground of enquiry, what can the secret motives of Sovereigns be, who are apparently interested, and who on former occasions have been most forward in taking the alarm, to make them remain on the present occasion silent and indifferent.
Next to that, as to the importance of Corsica itself it does in truth appear in a light of defence so trifling an object and so little deserving the expense I may say already incurred, that that very consideration is sufficient to show that something more is meant, for it cannot be with any degree of credibility asserted that a power like France can really apprehend the enmity of a little island, which must feel itself too happy in its exemption from oppression to risk the heavy hand of a mighty kingdom like that of France, whose conduct in this whole affair has by no means been of a defensive nature, but carried on with that reserve and obscurity in the commencement of the design, and rapidity in its execution, which gives just reason to suspect further views than they even now profess; nor can we any more form a judgment at this time what this matter may end in, than we could at the end of March last foresee what has since happened, having only the same assurances to trust to. � The experience of all ages shows us that facts alone are to be rested upon between nations, the professions of Ministers being in all times found dangerous and not to be relied upon. Your Excellency is sufficiently apprized of His Majesty�s desire to maintain the public tranquility, of the several proofs he has given of it upon different occasions, never declining to give the utmost satisfaction, where it has been desired with cordiality and with openness. If there is any instance which will bear a contrary surmise, your Excellency is aware that it has been owing not to His Majesty, but to others declining to come to that open and friendly adjustment of everything depending, which was professed to be their wish. On the other hand your Excellency must be sensible how different the conduct of the Court of France has been in this very instance. It is in vain for the French Minister to pretend that he was not apprized of the manner in which their getting possession of Corsica would be received here, for your Excellency warned him of it, at the time that he solemnly declared to you that no resolution whatever had been taken as to the Treaty in question. He afterwards assured your Excellency that the Convention would soon be made public even in the Paris Gazette, and that there was nothing but what had been done before by Vienna and France in furnishing the Genoese with auxiliaries to recover their own possessions; notwithstanding which a session plainly appears on the face of the Treaty, and is so clearly the intention, that the Minister himself, in a subsequent conversation, did not scruple to avow, that he believed the Genoese would never be able to reimburse them, and even never intended it.� Add to this the alliances which France has since the late peace cultivated with the greatest assiduity, the several preparations which have been continually making both by France and Spain with a. view to war sooner or later, the dry and unfriendly conduct of the latter, which is too well known to act under the influence of France, not to mention the several secret intelligences, to which your Excellency is no stranger, of the endeavours of France to keep alive in every part of His Majesty�s dominions every principle of division.
In this situation it is His Majesty�s pleasure that your Excellency should use your utmost endeavours to learn the true motives of the Court of France taking a step in regard to Corsica, which for forty years past they have never ventured upon, though as far as regards Genoa it has been equally in their power ; as well as to know the real object the Duke of Choiseul has in view: whether this has been upon a settled plan of the Court of France, or is a measure of the Duke of Choiseul�s own, relying upon the reports he may have heard of party divisions, or the opinion he may have conceived of the unconnected state of England.
In the meantime I am to acquaint your Excellency that nothing could surprise His Majesty more than the idea mentioned by your Excellency, �que nous �tions unpeu adoucis sur cette alfaire,� His Majesty�s opinion having been always the same upon it.
The crimes and frauds of the servants in India, enormous as they appear in the Reports sent your Lordship, are not I believe yet fully stated. The Directors, occupied in domestic pursuits equally fraudulent, have produced the effect of accomplices throughout ; while the proprietors, who, as the last resort, ought to be the purest to the objects of their charter, appear the most servile instruments of both, and to have their spirit directed by their several leaders, to answer nothing else than the different purposes of a ministerial market. Nor has there been found as yet, to speak impartially, anywhere in the House of Commons that firm, even, judicial spirit, capable of administering, much less of originating that justice which the case requires; and your Lordship will easily imagine the effect of scenes which daily arise there, from the activity and double dealing of the Court operating upon the situation and circumstances of individuals, in an interval when no avowed leader appears on either side, nor no one common object. In the meantime, the public judgment, as is often the case, goes to the right object, though on wrong reasoning. It is generally felt that the affairs of India are mismanaged; but the reasons given why they are so, are that charter rights should be inviolable, and that it is the last degree of hardship not to leave men the disposal of their own money and of the offices and emoluments arising from the distribution of it. While no one proprietor stands out to demand general justice, and the aid of Parliament at large for the safety or recovery of his property, but all act within the narrowest party limits, it is not surprising that the public should overlook the effect which any new system will have on the general commerce and government of the kingdom.
After a very short debate on the first clause, regarding the duration of the Direction, I divided for it without speaking. It was my intention to act in exactly the same manner, upon the same motives, when the qualification clause came on, though Lord Talbot as well as the Duke of Richmond made a slight opposition to it; but Lord Denbigh obliged me to change my plan of silence. In defending it he chose (with Lord Bute�s proxy) to declare, that he was for raising the qualification of all the electors of England. I was thus necessitated to declare my abhorrence of such an alarming plan of policy and such injustice, and to state the true grounds upon which I conceived Parliament could alone proceed in such cases, as guardians of charters, whose objects must ever be held sacred; which in the borough of Shoreham was an honest election of representatives, in the case of the India Company an honest administration of the exclusive trade. This led me to state shortly my opinion of the situation of the Company, arising from the misconduct of servants, directors, and acting proprietors; the necessity for the interference of Parliament, in behalf both of the honest proprietors as well as the public. The Duke of Richmond chose to reply, that the Company are in a very good state ; which required as little the interference of Parliament, as their conduct did its censure, and made some apologies for the part I took. This began an altercation between his Grace and me, which lasted almost the whole of that and the two following days. He gave me repeated opportunities of stating my own conduct; my endeavours, in and out of the House, to promote a real inquiry in 1767; my reasons for the Restraining Bill then passed to save the prize from plunder, &c. The Duke of Grafton afterwards told me, in conversation, that he could witness what I had said as to myself, and that I could do him justice as to what his wishes were.
When we came to the clause which contained the new appointments, the House suffered me to go into a very large discussion of it. To prevent misrepresentation. as well as because all that passed in the House of Commons had left no very distinct impression, I stated three modes of proceeding, which were all that occurred to me as possible: first, to take the whole into the hands of Government; which could not be, as it would certainly be subversive of the charter, as well as of very questionable policy; secondly, to leave it entirely in the hands of the Company, making them as responsible as possible; and, thirdly, to send out a Commission to report to Parliament as to men and things; which I proposed, as appearing to me far more eligible than the present appointments, which partook of the inconveniences of all three, without any of the advantages.
It is in vain to attempt communicating to your Lordship all that passed ; but I concluded the last day by giving my vote for the Bill, very much upon the general reasoning of your Lordship�s letter, which I was honoured with afterwards; stating, besides the defects I have mentioned, one general defect in the principle of the Bill, that of not distinguishing between the trade and revenue; which was practicable, because they are in their nature separate, and certainly were so in the Mogul Government. The Duke of Richmond and Lord Rockingham would fain have made it out that I meant the patronage a boon to the Crown, but I flatter myself that I left that matter as your Lordship would approve.
I do not recollect much more that is material to trouble your Lordship with at present. There are, however, two passages your Lordship should know. I took occasion upon the judges� clause to press their being appointed for life, and expressed my wishes that the same policy might be extended to America. The subject of America being renewed the last day, Lord Dartmouth, in terms of very great personal civility, declared his determination to support such a proposition for America, and, as I understood him, to place his existence in the Ministry upon it. I told him afterwards, in conversation, that I would acquaint your Lordship of it, knowing that it would give you real pleasure. The other was a declaration of Lord Rockingham�s, who avowed himself the protector of the India Company, happen what will here or there, to a renewal even of their charter, upon the same terms of exclusive right.
