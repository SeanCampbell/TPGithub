LETTER V
March 26, 1774
IT is demanded, with an air of confidence and imaginary triumph, �Were not the first settlers in America British subjects? Did they not settle under the sanction of grants and charters? Hath not the kingdom, at all times, put itself to great expences in their support, and favoured them with many peculiar advantages in trade? Was not the last most expensive war undertaken solely on their account? Can any one be so absurd, as to imagine the kingdom intended to nurse and erect so many independent nations, instead of enlarging her own dominion? Ought not the Americans to repay us part of the expences of the war in particular, in order to enable us to discharge some part of that enormous debt it occasioned? and contribute their proportion towards the general expences of the whole empire?� To most of these questions, my arguments have already answered. Now, let me ask, in my turn, Have any of the nations, of the earth, especially the free ones, become what they are, in, consequence of the intentions, and by a regular plan for that purpose; of the governments of those countries from which they are respectively descended? When we speak of the Greeks as an Egyptian colony, or of the Carthaginians as a colony of Pn�nicians, do we the less consider them as free nations? or imagine that the mother-countries had a right to govern or to tax them, because the first settlers had once stood in the relation of subjects to those states? Let the intention of government, in planting a colony, be what it may, 'tis impossible it should take away an inherent unalienable right; such, for instance, as freedom. But what Britain principally intended, she hath certainly obtained�an extension of commerce.  Again, let me ask, hath not Providence usually carried on its gracious designs of making great nations, and peopling
new regions, contrary to the councils of the wise ones of this world? While we are plotting and contriving, toiling and sweating, treating and waging war, in order to gratify our own self-interest and pride, by extending our commerce, and enlarging our empire beyond all bounds, Providence takes care to frustrate our foolish and wicked projects, and often brings about the reverse
of what we think to insure by the depth of our policy, and the strength of our arm. Let us take care that we do not provoke it to make us a scorn and approach to America, instead of' its arrogant ruler. By adhering strictly to the principles of justice, and the rights of mankind, we may firmly unite and cement together our own interests with those of our sister nations in America, and remain ourselves to the end of time, a powerful and independent state: but let us dread, by a violation of these sacred duties, to pull down upon our devoted heads the mighty ruins of an over-grown empire. Let it be the
peculiar glory of this free, this enlightened, this christian kingdom, to extend the influence of her religion and laws, not the limits of her empire! Nor let her entertain one anxious thought concerning the hackneyed notion of the progress of empire westward. Who are these presumptuous unsolders of the decrees of fate, these revealers of the hidden councils of God, that doom Great Britain to a speedy fall, when empire shall have fixed it's seat in America? Are the dispensations of Divine Providence so uniform and regular, as to become the object of science and proud philosophy? � to be foretold by man, or calculated like the movement and appearance of a comet? Our philosophical prophets pretend to judge from similar causes producing similar effects: but they ought to know, that in all essentials, there is yet very little or no similitude between the state of Great Britain and any antient empire
whatever: and I am not without faith, that there will always be wisdom and virtue enough in this happy island, to prevent its ever coming within that predicament. It behoves her, however, for instruction, to have a constant
retrospect to them and their fate. Let her maturely reflect on the insatiable avarice and ambition, the enormous, the gigantic wickedness of bloody Rome. Let her consider also the Grecian, the Persian, and Assyrian empires, and
carefully mark the grand causes of their overthrow. They were all erected on the rotten foundations of Idolatry and tyranny, (the very feed-plots of hell) they all fell the victims of their own mad ambition, and a lust of rule, that
nothing could satiate less than the dominion of the whole earth. Where is the similitude! Our religion, being a divine revelation, is confessedly perfect; and the law of nature, no less divine, being the immoveable basis of our  political fabric, the very foul of our constitution, this also is perfect. I say perfect, absolutely perfect; for whenever it hath the appearance of being otherwise it
is only from the want of a right interpretation, or a close adherence to its true principles. It is this immutable, this divine standard, we have to refer to in all our deviations, that hath preserved our constitution through all ages, and improved it till it is become the admiration and envy of all nations. This is a principle of renovation and recovery from all corruption and decays; this is a 
principle of immortality! No other constitution ever had the same, or at least never preserved it until it was sufficiently understood, and properly valued by the people. This has, under a most singular Providence, been our peculiar blessing. I trust it will be the blessing of our posterity to the latest generations; and that, when we shall have given birth, and the birthrights of freemen, to as
many independent states as can find habitations on the vast American continent, that Britain still will be great and free; the respected mother, the model, the glory of them all! and I will, I must indulge the fond hope, that the pure religion, and the perfect constitution of Britain, will gradually spread themselves over all America; and in every other part of the globe; so enlighten and operate upon the minds of men, as to become the chief instruments in
the Hands of Almighty God of bringing about, in his due time, that universality of Christianity, that harmony and happiness among the nations of the earth, which are intimated in the prophetic writings. Those prophetic intimations themselves, the peculiar fitness of the causes to the effects, together with a great variety of circumstances, that seem evidently tending towards this point, convince me, that it may be rationally hoped for; while all the arguments brought to shew the probability of America becoming the seat of a mighty conquering empire, to which Britain shall, in length of time, be a province, appear to my apprehension, to be destitute of any foundation of the smallest degree of probability. 
   We are told, that empire hath been observed to make its progress westward; that every empire hath had its infancy, its youth, its vigour, its declension, its death; and that they necessarily follow each other with the same certainty as in frail life of man; and lastly, we are reminded, that Great Britain hath past her meridian, and empire is now rising fast in Americas. To the first, I answer, that empire must needs have travelled westward from its source, except Europe had remained a desert; that it also travelled East, South, and North, as well as West, witness China, Indostan, Abyssinia, Russia; and that it hath already been in America, witness Peru and Mexico; and that it hath also taken retrograde courses, witness Turky and the Persian empire under Nadir Shah; and with regard to modern Europe, I can see no probability why it may not remain to the end of time, divided in proportions, not much differing from the present. To the second argument, I have only to say, that analogical reasoning is always very fallacious, and that there is no analogy between things mortal and immortal: To the third, I must repeat, that Great Britain, having in her constitution the principles of renovation and recovery from corruption and decay, and the feeds of immortality (which no other state ever had) is in no great danger of a declension, so long as this world is likely to last; and that the
British North American states having, all of them, Christianity void of persecution, as a light from heaven; British freedom as a soul, and a spirit of commerce as the breath of life; it must be thought next to an impossibility
that any one of them should ever swallow up all the rest, and then extend its conquests beyond the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The times for "heroes and demi-gods" are past; and the phrenzy for universal empire is somewhat out of date and out of countenance. They prevailed, and only could prevail, when the minds of men were in a proper tone for such extravagances; when the
advantages of commerce, the true principles and ends of government, and the religion of peace and pure virtue were either wholly or very imperfectly known: besides, no searcher into prophecy hath yet discovered in the womb
of time, an empire that is to be so formidable to the liberties of the world; and, if it be true, that the species, as well as the individual of mankind, obtains knowledge, wisdom, and virtue progressively; its latter days will, according to the nature of things, and by means of the Divine assistance that hath been vouchsafed it, to all appearance, be more wise, peaceable, and pious, than the earlier periods of its existence. To this end let every one labour; and his own happiness at least, if not the general happiness of mankinds will most assuredly be his reward.
