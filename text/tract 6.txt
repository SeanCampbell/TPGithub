In the latter part of this sentence, indeed, the Prophet manifestly alludes to the inferior Nature (THE NATURE OF MAN) which this Divine Person was to assume, for the Angels were not HIS FELLOWS; but Men:-it was Human Nature alone that was to be exalted and restored by that peculiar union with the Divine Nature in Christ, whereby all Mankind are rendered FELLOWS and BRETHREN to him �that is ready to judge the quick and the dead,� and may thereby become if (their own negligence and willful abuse of God�s gifts do not prevent them) even FELLOW HEIRS. But the Apostle, nevertheless, amply proclaims the Eternal Existence and Divine Nature of that Person, mentioned in his quotation from the 45th Psalm, who was to be anointed above HIS FELLOWS; for he immediately afterwards quotes another Psalm to assert the ETERNAL DIGNITY AND POWER of the same Person-Thus it appears, that our Redeemer was not only JEHOVAH in Name, but in Effect or Reality also, if the true meaning of that title be considered, as his being THE FIRST and THE LAST, demonstrates his Eternal Existence and Power as much as the Name of JEHOVAH.-Compare the last-mentioned text with the exhortation of GOD by Isaiah (xli. 10.) to his people Israel. And this LORD, or JEHOVAH, who here declares himself to be THE GOD of Israel, proclaims his own ETERNAL EXISTENCE near the beginning of the same chapter in the very same terms that were used in the Revelations by him. 
The reason here assigned by the Apostle for the illegality of JUDGING our Brother, is, that, to whom he attributes the dignity of JEHOVAH, by maintaining in the preceding context, that he is THE LORD, to whom we live and die, &c. and by applying to him Isaiah�s predication of universal homage to JEHOVAH, as if Christ himself, in his pre-existent state, had said I (am) JEHOVAH, &c.-�Unto me every knee shall bow,� &c.-And from this application of the Prophecy to the Person of Christ, the Apostle immediately draws a conclusion with a manifest reference to what he had before said of our standing at the Judgment Seat of Christ.
From this whole quotation it appears, that when the Apostle asserts the dignity of Christ, as being THE LORD of us all-(that we live and die �UNTO THE LORD.� &c.) he in effect applies to him the dignity of JEHOVAH, as that title is usually expressed in Greek by, THE LORD. In the Septuagint translation we read, that is, �Hear, O Israel, JEHOVAH our God, is ONE JEHOVAH.� -And the same text is expressed exactly in the same words by the Evangelist Mark (xii. 29.) where he recites our Lord�s answer to the question of the Scribe about the first or (chief) Commandment; for the Evangelist unquestionably substitutes the word (Lord) in his Greek text for (Jehovah) in the original Hebrew, of which there are many more instances in the New Testament; so that from thence we are taught the true import and meaning of the title �the Lord,� as applied to Christ in the New Testament.
LORDS there are, indeed many; and the word is of as general use and application in the Greek Tongue, perhaps, as SIR in the English Tongue; but yet, whenever it is preceded by the article and has no express reference to any particular place, title, office, or temporal dignity, it must necessarily, in that case, be understood as a title of Supreme Dignity, because it is then applicable to no other Being, but that alone, which is most eminently the Lord as being �Lord of all;� so that the title, THE LORD (and many times even without the article) is with propriety substituted in the Greek Scriptures for the title JEHOVAH, in translations and quotations from the Hebrew original, wherein that Holy Name occurs!
It would take up too much of my reader�s time (as well as of my own) were I to cite all the examples that may be found in the Greek Scriptures, of quotations from the Hebrew text, wherein the word, or Lord, is substituted for the Hebrew title Jehovah: however, I have inserted in the preceding note a sufficient number (I hope) of examples from the Evangelists to demonstrate, beyond contradiction, the true meaning and importance of the Greek title, (LORD) when it is applied to GOD, or to CHRIST; for in that case, if there is any truth in the Evangelists, as faithful translators, it implies and expresses nothing less than the dignity of JEHOVAH! Exactly in this sense, therefore, we must necessarily understand the Apostle Paul, when he tells us, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians. 
The effect of this translation of mine will appear sufficiently justifiable if it is compared with a parallel expression of John the Baptist recorded by John the Evangelist.
Now it must be allowed that none, except �the God of Israel, whose name alone is JEHOVAH,� (Psa. 1xxxiii. 18.) can justly be said to be ABOVE ALL!
So that if THE MESSIAH was not truly GOD, and included with the Almighty Father and the Holy Ghost in the Eternal BEING, JEHOVAH, this expression (that he �IS ABOVE ALL�) could not, with the least propriety, be so peremptorily and repeatedly applied to him! But as John the Baptist (who was sent to prepare the way of JEHOVAH, as I have already remarked) has positively asserted concerning him that �cometh from heaven� that he �is above all,� we must necessarily conclude, that �THE LORD FROM HEAVEN� (the title applied to Christ by the Apostle Paul in the parallel text recited above) is a title of supreme Dignity, and implies as much as if the Apostle had expressly intituled the Messiah-�JEHOVAH from heaven;� for had this latter been literally expressed by some Prophet in the Hebrew tongue, the Apostle�s words, would have been the regular Greek version of such an expression, which I have already proved by a variety of examples.
But Christ is not only THE LORD (or JEHOVAH) from heaven, but he is also �the Lord of Glory,� one of the highest titles that can be conceived! So that if he were not really of one and the same Divine Nature with the Almighty Father, this title of Supreme Excellence, �THE LORD OF GLORY,� could not be used with the least degree of propriety, especially as God (i.e. the LORD Jehovah) has declared to the Jews, that he will not give his Glory to another �viz. 
If Christ, therefore, is the �LORD OF GLORY,� he must necessarily be esteemed ONE with the Father, in the Eternal BEING JEHOVAH!-Our Lord himself also declared, �I and the Father are ONE.�
And yet this very sentence, which asserts THE UNITY of the Father and the Son, expresses, at the same time, a manifest Distinction of Persons; which is also clearly demonstrable in almost every other page of Scripture; though the doctrine of the Unity of God is not less clearly laid down and inculcated throughout the Scriptures!
Our Lord has delivered this doctrine of his Unity with the Father, in various modes of expression; and yet the true nature and manner of that UNITY must still remain a Mystery, because a perfect knowledge of that Eternal BEING, which in every way is infinite, cannot possibly fall within the comprehension of our finite understandings!
This doctrine is, nevertheless, a necessary part of our Faith; because the Scriptures contain such a proportion of evidence, really within the measure of Human judgment, as is sufficient to authenticate the whole, and demonstrate the Divine Mission of those Holy Persons, by whom they were, from time to time, delivered for our instructions and therefore, as we are answerable to God for the use or abuse of that Knowledge of Good and Evil, which we inherit from our first parents (as I have already shown in the beginning of this Tract) we cannot reject any part of the Scripture Evidence, without being guilty of such a manifest perversion and abuse of that hereditary Knowledge, as must render us highly culpable before God, and endanger our eternal welfare! We are bound, therefore, to receive even some things that we do not understand, instructed Philip to believe this very doctrine of his UNITY WITH THE FATHER, for the sake of the mighty Works which he had shown him: for these, indeed, were evident to his sense, and could not be denied; and therefore, as the Divine Mission was so strongly authenticated, Philip was bound to receive the whole Doctrine of the Gospel, as delivered by Divine Authority, even though he did not comprehend it! And, in like manner, is every man indeed obliged to submit his judgment in receiving and acknowledging these revealed mysteries of our religion, for the sake of that substantial evidence which the Scriptures afford us of other Truths and Facts, which fall more immediately within the measure of Human Comprehension.
But our Lord, nevertheless, condescended to illustrate this doctrine, in some degree, by a most interesting comparison, which relates, very materially, to the principal subject of this Tract, (THE NATURE OF MAN) because it informs us, at the same time, concerning that intimate Connexion with THE DIVINE NATURE, which HUMAN NATURE is rendered capable of acquiring, through the Divine Mediator between GOD and Man!
Here is a glorious declaration of the Dignity, to which God has been pleased to call MANKIND! And as the Unity of the Disciples, or true Believers, is thus clearly compared to the Unity of THE FATHER and THE SON, it is manifest that the doctrine of the last-mentioned UNITY (as far as the Scriptures have revealed it to us) is a topic necessarily included in the subject of this Tract-�The Nature of Man.� But this Unity of THE FATHER and THE SON is not in all respects the same Unity, as there wherein the Church (or Congregation of Disciples and true Believers) is included with the Father and the Son; though the Faithful undoubtedly partake of the Divine Nature by the HOLY SPIRIT, agreeable to the promises, and both CHRIST and THE FATHER are �IN THEM,� as our LORD said.
Thus HUMAN NATURE is capable of being exalted and dignified, even in this life, notwithstanding the uncertainties and sufferings attending our worldly condition!
The Faithful, indeed, are ONE in the Father, and the Son, as our Lord prayed for them to his Heavenly Father, but we must be careful to maintain the due distinction between the Unity of THE FATHER and THE SON, and the Unity of the Faithful in the Father and the Son! The latter is, indeed (in some respect or other) like the former, alike probably in that very circumstance alone of being in Unity-in Unity of WILL, of LOVE, and UNIVERSAL Benevolence, &c. but it is not altogether the same Unity, wherein the Scriptures declare the Almighty Father and his Son to be ONE (as some Socinians have conceived) or it could not with propriety be compared with it! Like is compared with Like; but �Like is not the same,� even to a proverb! In what respect the latter Unity may be like the former, I have already shown by authority of Scripture: but THE HEAVENLY FATHER and HIS SON are ONE in many other respects, which cannot with the least degree of propriety be attributed to the Unity of the Church in Christ! The Son of God is ONE with his Almighty Father in Eternal Existence, in that BEING of Eternity, JEHOVAH! They are ONE also in Power and Divine Attributes! The Son being expressly intitled �LORD OF ALL.� �THE LORD OF GLORY,� and is also declared to be �ABOVE ALL,� and �OVER ALL, God BLESSED FOR EVER.� These are undoubtedly Attributes of the Heavenly Father (and many more shall hereafter be mentioned in the course of the argument) so that THE FATHER and THE SON are manifestly ONE in these several respects, and in many more, as there is but ONE GOD, or ONE JEHOVAH! But the Unity of the Congregation of true Believers, (that they are ONE in Christ, &c. must be considered in a more confined sense: the true Believers are ONE glorious Universal Church, ONE Building, of which our LORD JESUS CHRIST is �the Foundation,� �the chief Corner Stone,� �they are a Spiritual House,� �a Bride�, a Being of many in one, as the symbol of the Cherubim, four living Creatures in one, which moved with one Spirit, and represented the Hosts of Israel and of course all those that are engrafted on that stock (the Olive-tree of Israel) through Christ are in like manner esteemed ONE; because all distinctions of Nation, Rank, and Dignity, and even of Sex, are set aside in the true Church - Thus the Faithful are one in Christ, but surely not with Christ; - I mean, not with him, in the UNITY of the Power, Glory, and Eternal Existence, wherein he and the Holy Ghost are (and ever were) included with the Almighty Father! The Unity of the Church is, indeed, in some respects (as I have shown) LIKE the Unity of THE FATHER and THE SON, but it is not the same Unity, as the Socinians would insinuate. In the Communion Service of the Church of England, indeed, mention is made of our Unity WITH Christ but this has not the least reference to the Unity of Christ WITH the Father, but only to be declared Unity of the Faithful, who form that one Building. So that all faithful disciples are, undoubtedly, ONE in Christ (that is, ONE �Holy Temple,� or ONE Catholick Church) even as the Father and the Son are ONE: but it must appear from the several texts already quoted (if they are duly compared and weighed together) that the Unity of the Church in Christ, is not mentioned as the same Unity, wherein the Father and the Son are ONE (viz. One in Power, Glory, and Eternal Existence, or One GOD) but only as a resemblance or illustration in some respects, of that DIVINE UNITY!-In some respects (I say) as being united in Will or in Divine Love (as I have already shown) or by the inspiration of the HOLY SPIRIT in each individual, through which the whole Congregation of the Faithful that are �builded together� in Christ, become �an Habitation of GOD,� but not in all respects, because there are many circumstances (some of which I have already mentioned) wherein the Unity, or Fellowship, or Christ with the Heavenly Father is infinitely transcendent, and such as cannot, without Blasphemy, be attributed to the redeemed Brethren, or those that are merely Members of the Church; so that the Socinian objection to the doctrine, which necessarily arises from the several texts, wherein the Father and the Son are declared to be ONE, is apparently unjust and false! Thus Christ declares his right to be glorified with the Heavenly Father himself, which must mean, to be glorified with SUPREME GLORY, as it is the Glory of the Almighty Father, �the Glory which� the Son had with his Almighty Father �before the world was!� This glorious Person assumed the NATURE OF MAN, and for a time dwelt among men, that he might �fulfill all righteousness� even in his Human Nature, and thereby restore the lost dignity and privileges of that Nature; Human Nature, therefore, is indeed exalted to eternal Glory, but that is only in, by, and through him, who alone is truly and essentially the �SON OF GOD,� as well as the �SON OF MAN!� The miserable state of fallen MAN is already described in the former part of this Tract. The means of retrieving our lost dignity remains still to be shown. God has mercifully revealed to us these necessary means, and tendered them in the Scriptures to our Choice, that by a prudent use of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, we may constantly prefer, and chuse the Good, earnestly claiming the promises of Divine Assistance; whereby we shall also be enable to reject the Evil on all occasions, and effectually to resist the Spiritual Enemy, and maintain our integrity in the severest trials of our Faith. 
Thus the device of SATAN, in promoting MAN�S assumption of forbidden Knowledge, is completely turned against himself; for that very KNOWLEDGE, which (through his deceit and temptation) subjected all Mankind to SIN and Death, is now (through the mercy of God) become a proper Principle of Action (if we use it as we ought) to incline us to RIGHTEOUSNESS, and lead us to �the Tree of Life!� But we must remember, at the same time, that this Knowledge in Man is far from being of itself sufficient for these purposes! The dignity and privileges of Human Nature cannot be known, nor the manner of communicating them properly understood without a right Faith in the Dignity and Divine Nature of Christ; because, in his Promises alone, our title to those extraordinary Privileges is founded!
A right Faith, therefore, concerning the true Dignity of that Divine Person, in whose Name we hope to obtain the heavenly Gift of the Holy Ghost, is undoubtedly necessary; and we must �give him the honour due unto his Name,� or the very mention of that Name, instead of entitling us to favour, would be an offence to God, who �hath highly exalted� his only begotten Son.
In a preceding verse (viz. 17th) our Lord, in like manner, compared (with a seeming insinuation of equality) his own works with the works of his Father-�My Father worketh hitherto� (said he) �and I work.�
The Father which worketh hitherto, was clearly understood by the Jews to signify the Almighty Father, the Worker or Maker of all things, and therefore they could neither brook the mention he made in the same sentence of his own working, nor the particular claim which our Lord expressed in that sentence to the Almighty Father as his peculiar Father, calling him My Father, instead of Our Father, as the common Parent or Creator of Mankind.
For the call God his peculiar Father was justly esteemed by the Jews the same thing as making himself �equal with God,� though they were unjustly incensed at it, through a want of due attention to the mighty Works (similar to those of the Almighty Father) to which Christ appealed, as a proof that he was really the Son of God!
That SUPREME HONOUR is therefore due unto THE NAME AND PERSON OF THE SON, our Blessed Redeemer, who, for our SAKE, took THE NATURE OF MAN upon himself, is manifest, because we are expressly commanded to honour the Son, even as we honour the Father.
To �honour the Son� even as they �honour the Father, � would be idolatry, if the Son was not a Divine Person, really and truly God from all Eternity! Because the God of Israel, the Eternal and Everlasting Jehovah, and Creator of all things, at the very time that he promised this Glorious Redeemer he immediately added in the very next sentence Isai. Xlii. 5-8. Yet Christ will surely come in the GLORY of his Father.
It is impossible therefore, that the Supreme God, JEHOVAH, should �give his Glory,� or require Men to honour the Son, even as they honour the Father, if the Son was another, or not in Unity or One with the Father in the Eternal Being of the One God; I mean, if he was not included in the One Eternal Divine Being which is but ONE that is, UNITY ITSELF, and therefore incapable of different Degrees, or Inequality. And yet we find, that this glorious Name of the One Eternal God of Israel, viz. Jehovah is manifestly attributed, both in the Old and New Testaments (as I have already shown), to the Messiah as a distinct Person from the Father; and therefore, when we read our Lord�s expression in John. �My Father is greater than I,� we must necessarily understand, that no comparative reference can possibly have been intended thereby, nor is to be made, concerning the Divine Nature, or Godhead, which certainly is but One, viz. �ONE JEHOVAH,� as the text expressly declares, and consequently we must acknowledge with the Author of the Creed, commonly attributed to Athanasius, that or his Mediatorial Office; for in some such qualified sense we must of course understand our Lord�s expression in John (�the Father is greater than I�) before mentioned; for those Men, who venture to assert, that the Inferiority of the Son consists in his Divine Nature, must evidently suppose a Superior and Inferior Divine Nature, and consequently, that there are TWO Divine Natures, which Idea the Scriptures expressly forbid-�(JEHOVAH, OUR GOD, is ONE JEHOVAH,� - And therefore, as the Son is also JEHOVAH, we are bound by the Scriptures to believe, that he is of the same Divine Nature with the Father in that One Eternal Being, agreeably to what he himself has declared-�I and the Father are One.� And as the Plurality of Persons is clearly expressed in the latter text by the Plural Verb, we are; so the word, One, evidently demonstrates the UNITY and EQUALITY of their Divine Nature; for it is no less evident from the context, that the said word, ONE, refers to the Being of God, or Jehovah, and was intended to express the Unity of their Divine Nature. The Jews, it is plain, understood the expression in that sense, and immediately charged our Lord with Blasphemy-saying-�Because that thou, being a Man, makest thyself God.� And though our Lord condescended to cite a passage from the Psalms, wherein the title of Gods is applied to mere Men, viz. �I said ye are Gods,� in order to show, that the Scriptures would not be broken by the consequence which they had drawn from his expression; yet he immediately after maintains the evident meaning of his first expression, as it was at first understood by the Jews, and, by a fair comparison, showed his infinite superiority over them that were called Gods, in the Law. And our Lord immediately added an incontestable proof of his being GOD [not merely in a confined, qualified Sense, like those Men called GODS in Scripture, but GOD also] in Effect and Power!
This reference to the Works of the Father, was a manifest appeal of Christ to the understanding of his hearers, concerning the peculiar manner in which he was really God, and of the same Divine Nature with the FATHER agreeably to the obvious sense of his first proposition-�I and the Father are One,� - and the unbelieving Jews (notwithstanding their mental blindness, and hardness of heart, foretold by their Prophets) as plainly understood, that the necessary effect of this argument was exactly the same upon the whole, that they at first apprehended; viz. that he �MADE HIMSELF,� (i.e. declared himself to be really) �God,� and therefore they immediately renewed their wicked persecution as at first; for �they sought again to take him,� (says the text) �but he escaped out of their hands.�
My readers may perhaps think, that I prolong my work too much, and render it tedious, by inserting so many proofs concerning the Divine Nature of THE SON OF GOD; but alas! I find, that my labour on this point is become necessary! Many learned Men, and some, even of my own particular friends, have unhappily overlooked that indispensable doctrine, and do not perceive that the glorious Name JEHOVAH (the peculiar Name of THE ONE SUPREME GOD) is clearly in the Scriptures attributed also to the Son of God! And we cannot rightly understand the Nature and Dignity of MAN (which is my leading subject in this Tract) nor the true value of THE PRICE which was given for MAN�S REDEMPTION unless we are truly sensible of the Nature and Dignity (as far as God has revealed it to us in the Scriptures) of that Divine Person, who took Human Nature upon himself, in order to restore the lost Dignity and Privileges of fallen Man!
One of my learned friends (though a sensible and worthy man) amongst other arguments and quotations against my doctrine, remarks as follows.
Now that Christ is the Son of God, or (as my friend styles him) �the Son of Jehovah,� every true Christian must readily allow to be a true and indispensable doctrine; but it by no means follows from thence (though my friend says it necessarily follows) �that Christ is not Jehovah!� To the direct contrary of my friend�s assertion, I am obliged to remark, that as Christ is the Son of Jehovah, and the Son of God in a peculiar and essential manner, it necessarily follows from thence, that he is also really and truly GOD and JEHOVAH in an essential manner; for as a SON must necessarily partake of the Nature or Essence of his natural FATHER, so �THE SON OF JEHOVAH� must necessarily be of the same Nature, Being, or Essence, with his ALMIGHTY FATHER, JEHOVAH; and as there is but ONE JEHOVAH, must necessarily in some way or other (though incomprehensible to us at present) be included in that ONE ETERNAL BEING! The very circumstance which my friend assigns as a proof that �the Son is NOT JEHOVAH,� was esteemed by the unbelieving Jews (when our Lord was on earth) as a proof that he made himself equal with God!
