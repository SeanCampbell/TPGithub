LETTER IV
March 23, 1774
SOME theorists make a proposal to allow the Americans a representation in the British parliament, in order to justify our taxation of them; but from the small number of such representatives, which I have understood to be proposed, and their being restricted from voting, as some would have them, in any but American questions, I should fear that this proposal proceeded from a sense of shame, as not appearing to preserve even the common forms of justice, rather than from a strict and sacred regard to justice itself; or on a supposition, that this representation should be an adequate one, how would it be possible for the American representatives to serve their constituents in a proper manner. Could they, during every recess of parliament, visit their respective counties, as the members can in Great Britain? Could they, by a
post letter, in a day or two, communicate to, or receive from, their constituents all necessary intelligence? or, Could they meet and consult with them on all emergencies at a short notice? Must they reside a thousand or fifteen hundred leagues from their estates and compting-houses, in order to serve their country in parliament? Surely so weak a system of government must have been the visionary suggestion of a dream! But we may rest assured, that while the Americans are themselves awake, they will never consent to it. Will they trust their property, their freedom, their dearest rights, their every thing, in the hands of exiles, sent half-way to the Antipodes, in order to sit in council for their government! sent to reside in a luxurious, extravagant country, immersed in dissipation and corruption, and exposed to every temptation to betray them ! Believe me, they are not so senseless. In the imaginations of these visionaries, the vast Atlantic is no more, I presume, than a mere ferry.
   Those who have thought proper to indulge themselves in the way of declamation, tell us of the mighty things done for the Americans by the mother country, and make a great cry of their rebellion and ingratitude. Nay, they are silly enough to urge these obligations as so many irrefragable reasons why the Americans are bound to obey the British parliament: on this foundation they build our right of sovereignty. But whoever heard of a suit prosecuted in any English court of justice for ingratitude? Is a frugal son, out of his little competency, and to the prejudice of his own children, obliged, by any law of England, or of nature, to minister to the extravagancies of a proud, luxurious parent, and in what degree that parent shall direct? Do the obligations of friendship deprive the person obliged of his future freedom and independency? Doth not an attempt to enslave, cancel; in a moment, every former obligation? These declaimers should keep in mind, that voluntary good offices are moral and religious, not civil or political, obligations. We may safely admit the whole catalogue of them in their full force, without thereby affording parliament the most shadowy pretension to the rights of sovereignty over the Americans: but, in justice to the character of that people, we must positively deny their existence; for they have been amply repaid in a profitable commerce to this country. Men must surely be lost to a sense of common decency, who would impose upon us as truth, that the part which government hath ever taken, in settling and assisting the American colonies, was solely or primarily to benefit the settlers; whereby they have been laid under this vast load of obligation to the mother country, which nothing less than a surrender of their liberty can conceal. Every honest, unprejudiced man, who will reason, and not t wrangle, must acknowledge, that government's first object was, as indeed it always ought to be, to extend the commerce of this kingdom. This was the end: the countenance and assistance given to American settlers, was only the means, and therefore could be no more than a secondary consideration. When the colonies were in danger of falling a prey to France, was it pure affection and generosity' towards them, or jealousy of that ambitious power, which caused Great Britain to take up arms? Did not her own existence depend on the preservation of her American colonies? so that, though we do not mean to say affection, for her kindred had no share in moving her to draw her sword, yet, we presume, it will be admitted, that her own safety, her own interest, her own honour, were the only motives that could have engaged her to proceed such lengths at that juncture; and this will the more evidently appear, when we consider, that according to her notions of her right to the sovereignty, she saw the protection of her colonies, literally in the light of defence, and the more heartily undertook it accordingly. Surely, it must be a very bad title to dominion, which is built upon, an error of her judgment, and apolitical selfishness. Had the Hanoverians, or Dutch, the Prussians, Portuguese, or Hungarians; had even the very French, with whom she fought, at that time stood in the place of her American colonies, she would, on the same principles, have been as lavish of her blood and treasure in their support, as every one of them hath heretofore experienced; and yet our opponents in argument, would not have maintained, that services of this kind, done to any such state, would have entitled this kingdom to the same right
of ruling and of taxing it, as they contend for upon the same principle in the cafe of America. America, therefore, is not ungrateful; but is not rather Great Britain unwise, ambitious, and tyrannical? The obligations, in fact, were mutual, and as equivalent as the nature of things would admit; so that it would be a very nice, perhaps an impossible, but certainly an useless speculation, to decide which party hath been most benefited. The attempt is insidious, and he who makes it, is no friend either to America or Great Britain. 
   Many definitions of government have been given us, and a multitude of arguments employed, in order to shew the well-known necessity of one central supreme power being somewhere lodged in every empire, which shall be all sufficient of itself to perform the whole of legislation, and consequently taxation, as an essential part of it. But this will make nothing for the claims of parliament to the sovereignty of America. On the reverse, it only points  out more strongly the error which most people have fallen into in their notion of the British empire. They will have it, that the British empire comprehends within it all his Majesty's dominions in America; whereas the American governments, except that of Newfoundland, are independent nations, having within themselves the rights and the actual powers of legislation, which cannot be taken from them, and lodged in the hands of British legislators, without a manifest wrong, and the subverting of so many free governments. Here we shall be told, that our Kings, in granting them their original charters and privileges, only exercised a prerogative which they derived from the constitution; wherefore the Americans are still dependent upon, and owe allegiance, not, to the King alone, but to the state of Great Britain. But still
I maintain, that the inherent rights of mankind, above all, their freedom, are not to depend on casuistical niceties and logical distinctions, (which, by the way, must be false, when they would disprove these rights) but are theirs independently of all the Kings, all the governments in the universe. Kings and constitutions of government are the creatures, not the creators, of these rights. They are held immediately of God himself, who gave them. Had the original charters to the American settlers been granted on the express and sole condition of acknowledging the sovereignty of parliament, even all that would
not have bettered our present title one jot; for freedom, notwithstanding all that sophistry may say to the contrary, cannot be alienated by any human creature; much less can he enslave his posterity; and, therefore, such a contrast could only be binding, so far and so long as freedom should not be infringed by it; but, with regard to a virtue in it, of depriving a future people, many nations, of their freedom, it would be null and void in its own nature to all intents and purposes ; and, 'tis a mockery to our common-sense, to plead it as an authority to this end.
   It is a mistaken notion, that planting of colonies, and extending of empire, are necessarily one and the same thing. Even the intention of the planters will not make it so, where the rights of mankind, and the nature of things are not adapted to it; where growing colonies are so situated and so circumstanced, that, in the nature of things, they cannot be governed by the parent state on the principles of justice and freedom; it is surely paying little respect to our understandings, and shocks every feeling of a free mind, to assert, that they must nevertheless submit to its oppressive rule. Having denied that America, when we drop the popular language, and speak correctly, is a part of the British empire, it will naturally be expected I should ï¿½say what are, and where are its limits. The British empire, then, I hold to be confined to the British
Isles, and to the various settlements and factories of our trade in the different parts of the world, including the government of Newfoundland; together with the garrisons of Gibraltar and Minorea. As to the West India islands, they, as well as the continental colonies, certainly have a right to their independency, whenever they shall think proper to demand it, as they contain within themselves every necessary of legislation; but, if it be their choice, to acknowledge the sovereignty of the British parliament, as I apprehend it may, because, I believe, it will be their interest, I see no objection in that case to its being exercised. If it be true, as I believe all writers agree, that they would be depopulated, was it not for annual supplies of white men as well as blacks, this, and some other arguments, .drawn from West Indian manners and sentiments, seem to indicate, that it is not in their nature, nor perhaps in their wish, to support an independency; nor ought we to forget, that their soil itself points out to them dependency, supplying only the means of effeminacy, luxury, and intoxication, while for bread, and the necessaries of life, its inhabitants must depend upon other countries. It matters not how much, in the nature of trading settlements, our first colonies might have been, (though were not in fact) nor at what period they might be said to become independent nations: It matters not that they were originally planted and protected by the
government of this country, (I admit this planting; I make no reservation of those who fled from persecution and want) nor what were the intentions of government in so doing ; for, having in them (the people of those colonies)
the inherent and unalienable rights of freemen, they had therein the rights of independency, whenever they should think proper to assert them. Doth a man, who furnishes a young indigent relation with every necessary, who settles
him in a trading accompting-house, who supplies him with money, and supports him with every species of protection whereby he prospers in the world, and raises a fortune; doth the man, I say, to whom he owes all this,
obtain thereby a right, a legal title, to lake from him, without his consent, a single shilling of this fortune? men 0f slavish principles would have us believe, that the rights of private persons, of subjects, being mean and insignificant considerations, are level with the capacities of, and may be comprehended by the people; but that the sublime and mysterious rights of empire are only to
be judged of, and determined upon, by those who govern, and by those to whom these mysteries are confidentially revealed, in order to be treated of with due profundity and unintelligibility, not to enlighten the people, but to impress them with a proper respect for things so aweful and sacred. True enough it is, that what hath too frequently been written concerning them, hath not been level with the capacities of the people, nor with any other capacities; for no man can understand what hath no sense or meaning, what is palpable nonsense.ï¿½
