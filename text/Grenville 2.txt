MR. GRENVILLE TO SIR JOHN QLYNNE
August 7, 1766
Dear Sir, � There is no occasion for you to make the least apology for your letter which I received last night; on the contrary, if upon this or any other subject I can give you any information or do anything which may be of use to you it will give me a very sincere pleasure.
As to the question which you ask of me whether Dr. Blackstone is right in his "Stemmata Chicheleana," No. 135, when he makes Sir Peter Temple marry Eleanor Tyrrel, as this does not agree with Willis's account of Buckinghamshire, and therefore whether Peter Temple, the father of John, might not be a knight and married to Eleanor Tyrrel, I apprehend that it is very easy to give you a satisfactory answer, though I have only one of the books which you mention, viz. "Willis's Account of Buckinghamshire." In page 276 of this book you will see that the eldest son of Sir Thomas Temple of Stowe was Sir Peter Temple of Stowe, who was grandfather to Lord Cobham, and to my mother; you will likewise see in the same page of the same book that the second son of Sir Thomas Temple of Stowe was Sir Thomas Temple of Stanton Barry. This Sir Peter Temple of Stanton Barry married Eleanor Tyrrel, and by her was father to Eleanor Temple, who intermarried with my grandfather Richard Grenville of Wotton, and was mother to my father and to Lady Conway, and another daughter who died young. By this account it appears there were two Sir Peter Temples, the one of Stowe, who was my mother's grandfather, the other of Stanton Barry, who intermarried with Eleanor Tyrrel, and was my grandmother's father. This is a full answer to the question which you ask. I have not the "Stemmata Chicheleana," but I suppose that book states it truly. If you have any further doubt, you may consult the new edition of the "Peerage of Great Britain," by Mr. Edmonstone, in which you will find the pedigree, I believe, very exactly stated under the article of Earl Temple, but I have not the book here, having left it in town. This I hope will be sufficient to clear up any difficulty on this head, and that your son will succeed in his application for a Fellowship of All Souls.
I do not write anything to you about the late extraordinary political transactions, the particulars of which you must have seen and read long ago: I will only say that I have had nothing to do with them in any shape, having expressly declined to have my name mentioned, and I rejoice extremely that Lord Temple has refused to engage upon a plan which was neither consistent with his honour nor safety, and of which there is no example; the express claim being to guide everything in a sinecure office and to be responsible for nothing. I cannot think that such a proposition can be attended with that good-will, credit, and permanency which the state of the kingdom so much requires, as private intrigue and the public distress and indignation will in all likelihood join to overturn it. I am very sorry to hear so bad an account of Mrs. Conway's health, which I fear is in a very dangerous situation. I shall at all times be glad of any opportunity to express the esteem and regard with which I am, &c, &c. George Grenville.

MR. GRENVILLE TO MR. CHARLES LLOYD
August 8, 1766.
Dear Lloyd, � The several packets containing the pamphlet published by Mr. Almon together with your
letter, came safe last night. There are certainly some mistakes in it, but I shall make no comments upon the general purpose of it, nor take any notice of the mistakes in it, except of one pretty essential one which relates personally to myself.
It is said, page 41st, that notwithstanding my being entirely "out of place, and excluded from all connection with the intended system, I would nevertheless support the Measures of their Administration." I desired Lord Temple not to clog or embarrass this transaction in any shape by mentioning me, but that if he could find it consistent with his honour and safety to engage in it, I would nevertheless give him all the assistance and support in my power, as far as I could consistently with my friends, and former opinions, and as far as he was concerned in it, but desired it might not be understood to go any further. I never engaged myself in any shape, either in or out of office, to support Mr. Pitt's Measures or Administration. This I desire you will tell everybody whom you see, and take some means to let Mr. Almon know it, and of having it contradicted as fully and effectually as you can. I would have assisted and supported my brother, Lord Temple, if he had taken the Treasury, as cordially and affectionately as I could, but I have so long and so highly disapproved Mr. Pitt's public conduct, his principles and his measures, that I never could make any such general declaration of support to him, though at the same time if he should change his sentiments, as he has so frequently done, and make any proposal which was really for the public service, I would not do as he has done by me, and oppose it from personal rancour and jealousy.
I am sorry to see Lord North in half an office, joined with that able statesman, Mr. George Cooke.
I desire you will return my sincerest thanks to Lord Townshend for the cordial manner in which you tell me he has expressed his good will, and his good opinion of me I have writ to nobody about the late transaction, who had not writ first to me, and have therefore omitted many of my most intimate friends, as you know; but if I had known in any way that Lord Townshend would have liked it, I certainly should have writ to him upon this occasion, which you may tell him from me, with my best compliments, whenever you see him. I am, &c, &c. George Grenville.
MR. GRENVILLE TO EARL TEMPLE
August 20, 1766
The intelligence which you sent me, my dear brother, by my nephew, Jemmy, was well founded, as you will see by the account I am going to give you.
I went to Woburn on Saturday last, the day that Lady Egremont left us, and found the Duke of Bedford, who received me with great friendship and openness, and said that if he had not seen me, he proposed to come to Wotton in the course of this week. He told me that he had heard nothing since he saw you, except that Lord Hertford, whom he had met in town, had assured him of his own wishes, and of the wishes of those with whom he was connected, to see the Duke of Bedford and his friends in Government; but this was in general only, and went no further.
On Saturday evening Lord Tavistock, who brought Lady Tavistock into the country that day, after her lying-in, informed the Duke of Bedford that the Duke of Grafton had sent to him on the Thursday preceding, desiring to see him the next day; that when they met, the Duke of Grafton began by making excuses for troubling him on a subject which possibly he might not like to intermeddle in, but that having something to say to the Duke of Bedford, he rather chose to do it by Lord Tavistock than to employ any underlings. He then expressed himself in very high terms concerning the Duke of Bedford, and dwelt upon it a great while, adding that though they had differed in Parliament, yet he hoped he had never been wanting in personal regard to him. That the Administration wished to see the Duke of Bedford and his friends in Government, and that, therefore, he desired to know how the Duke of Bedford stood affected towards the present Administration. That by Lord Egmont's resignation there was a vacancy in a great office, which they should be glad to see supplied by Lord Gower, through the Duke of Bedford's mediation and approbation, but that it must be understood that this proposal came only from them, and that if it was accepted, they would propose it to the King. On Lord Tavistock wishing to know whether anything further was intended besides this offer to Lord Gower, the Duke of Grafton said that no further offer was meant at present; that he knew Lord Chatham's idea was a great comprehensive and conciliating plan, but that he did not mean at present to turn out any of those who would act with the Administration. That he, the Duke of Grafton, was so desirous to see an union established which might bring together as much strength and ability as might be; that notwithstanding his attachment to Lord Chatham, he would not have come in if he had thought that Lord Chatham did not intend it. In answer to this, the Duke of Bedford wrote to the Duke of Grafton and to Lord Gower on Sunday, and showed me the letters to both of them'. He told the Duke of Grafton that his son had informed him what passed; that he was extremely sensible to the many obliging expressions which the Duke of Grafton had used concerning him; that he had wished to see the Duke of Grafton in office, because he thought him a friend to his country; that he had a great regard for him, and some others in the Administration, but that as to the question which was asked of him, he must freely declare that he and his friends having opposed the totality of the measures proposed by the last and supported by the present Administration, he must entirely decline taking any part by his mediation in this business, but left it to Lord Gower, upon any application made to him, to do as he should think best.
The Duke of Bedford's letter to Lord Gower contained an exact narrative of what I have writ to you, and a copy of his letter to the Duke of Grafton, telling him that by this means he had quite washed his hands of it, and that having done so, Lord Gower would act in it, if he heard anything more, as his own judgment should direct him.
The Duke of Bedford enjoined me secrecy, as Lord Tavistock was very unwilling that what passed in private conversation with him should be publicly discussed, but upon my desiring to communicate this to you, the Duke of Bedford very readily agreed to it, but under the seal of secrecy, which, as this is a matter of a delicate nature, is indispensably necessary to be observed.
The evident purpose of all this is, to break and divide us if possible, for which end your own words are now to be adopted, and a proposition made through another channel to those whom, when proposed by you, it was thought necessary absolutely to reject If I can trust my accounts from London, the indisposition even amongst those in office augments, as well as the public clamour both there and in the country. Adieu, my dear Brother, &c, &c.
George Grenville.

MR. GRENVILLE TO EARL TEMPLE
September 21, 1766.
My dear Brother, � Mr. Rigby gave me exactly the same account of the Duke of Bedford's dispositions with that contained in your letter; but I found his own wishes and opinion was to take an active part at the meeting of the Parliament, instead of laying by and waiting for events, as you tell me the Duke of Bedford proposes. I told him that must very much depend upon the part which our friends in general would take. That the consideration of the King's Speech was a kind of state of the nation, in which we were in some degree called upon to declare our sentiments, and that I should be under no difficulty to deliver mine, and should then see how far others were disposed to adopt them.
The account which the present Ministry have industriously given of the great civility and willingness of Lord Gower's letter, is, I find, one lie more added to the daily heap, as, by what I hear, that letter was, on the contrary, an answer of slight and even ridicule to the proposal, which was as weak in its manner as in the matter of it.
You will hear from Mr. Wedderburn, who told me that he should go to Stowe to-day or to-morrow, what he thinks of Lord Bute's situation; notwithstanding which I think it very possible that the Chamberlain's staff may be given to Lord Northumberland, who, it is generally thought, would not be unwilling to receive it.
The East India business, I am told, engrosses all conversation in town, and grows very serious. The people can hardly believe, notwithstanding the threats thrown out to the Directors, and the language holden by Alderman Beckford, &c, that after what passed last year with regard to North America and the West Indies, they will this year break through the charter of the East Indies which was purchased by the Company, and which has been repeatedly confirmed by many solemn Acts of Parliament.
This would be a stroke indeed worthy of their wisdom and consistency, and which will be a proper crown to the whole. There is to be a general Court of the Proprietors, I am told, next Wednesday, and we may then probably hear more of what is intended.
Lord Trevor has this moment left us; but the message which Mr. Rigby brought me from the Duke of Bedford, that he would come hither if a visit from the Duke of Marlborough did not stop him, keeps me at home for some days. I am, my dear Brother, &c, &c.
George Grenville.
MR. GRENVILLE TO THE EARL OF MANSFIELD
November 10, 1766
My dear Lord, � I have endeavoured to consider the hints contained in your letter with that attention which every thought of yours so well deserves, but I own I cannot see how it is possible to consider the Proclamation in any other light than as a Prohibition to export corn. It is meant as such and as such only, and if it is a Pro hibition, it is not only within the meaning, but within the very letter, of the 22 C. II. That Act does not extend to other Provision Ships, nor to Ireland, and therefore no argument can be drawn from thence; and yet with respect to corn, even to be exported from Ireland, an Irish Act of Parliament was passed last year to enable the King to prohibit the exportation from thence by the advice of the Privy Council of Great Britain or Ireland; and this was done, as I have been told by those concerned, after great consideration had here, and it was certainly founded upon an opinion, after a good deal of enquiry, that the King had not that power, even in Ireland, without it.
However pleasing it may have been to the people to stop the exportation by any means, yet the contending for such a prerogative, against the positive words and plain intention of an Act of Parliament, will, I believe, be too odious even for those concerned to insist upon, and this I am persuaded will be the case in the House of Commons, where, by what I have heard, there will not be one gentleman of the Law who will maintain it. This is my present opinion, not lightly taken up, for I have given all the attention to this question which I am able, and shall continue to do so, from the weight which the least doubt of yours must have with me.
I am much obliged to you for having communicated your thoughts to me upon this subject, and am with the most affectionate regard, my dear Lord, &c, &c.
George Grenville.
P.S. I do not know whether I shall have an opportunity of communicating your letter to Lord Lyttelton before this business comes on, but if I have, I will certainly do it.
MR. GRENVILLE TO EARL TEMPLE
November 18, 1766
My dear Brother, � An event has happened to-day, which fully shows in how different a light the House of Commons considers the doctrines of a dispensing power in the King superior to the Laws, from that in which it was represented in the House of Peers by those great State luminaries the Earls of Northington and Chatham and the Lord Chancellor.
Mr. Conway proposed a Bill of Indemnity for all those who acted under the Proclamation and Order of Council for prohibiting the exportation of wheat. I thought this ground too narrow, and proposed that those who advised it might be included in the Bill, but said that if the proposition was not consented to, I would not make the debate in a thin house, though I assured them that after the desperate doctrines which had lately been holden, of a power in the Crown superior to the Laws, this question should not be evaded, but be agitated to the bottom, when 1 saw how this Bill was framed.
Mr. Conway, in answer, did not insist upon the legality, though he refused the words extending it to advisers, &c. Many others spoke in doubtful terms, others were clear for the words of extension, amongst whom Mr. Pitt did very well. Alderman Beckford then spoke, and after many flourishes, said these words: "If the public was in danger, the King has a dispensing power."
I immediately called him to order, and made the Clerk of the House take down the words, to censure them in the strongest terms. Many got up to excuse him from weakness, inadvertence, ignorance, &c, but not one to support the doctrine. Alderman Beckford, after some debate of this kind, said I had stopped him too soon, for that he meant to have added, "with the consent of the Council, whenever the Salus Populi requires it." These words I again excepted to, and said that the explanation was at least as criminal as the first words, and directed those words to be taken down by the Clerk likewise, and endeavoured to show them as totally subversive of our Constitution, protesting that if the dispensing power were to be thus established, I thought every man dishonoured who would set his foot in the House afterwards. After this, many tried to palliate, but none to justify, and upon my insisting that the words should be retracted, or I would immediately move a censure, and that the House must either approve or censure, for the words must now stand upon the Journals; after an hour or two more, and an universal disapprobation of the doctrines contained in those words, Alderman Beckford thought fit to consult Mr. Hussey, and by his advice drew up the following explanation in these words, or to this effect: "That he meant to say, that in the most urgent necessity, it might be excusable to act contrary to law, which was only to be justified by Act of Parliament." As these words contained exactly my sense in almost my own words, I immediately consented to them, provided they were entered upon the Journals as the proof of our sense of the Law and Constitution. This was done, and thus this day's debate ended. I know not what preamble they will have to their Bill, but if there is not a full declaration of the Illegality, I shall certainly treat the question fully. What will the three great Ministers say? What a triumph to Lord Mansfield, and to you and your friends! It seems to me that this will produce curious scenes in the House of Peers, if made the most of, as it is most probable that the Bill will come up in a shape very different at least from the opinions laid down there, which however will, I believe, be softened, if not retracted. I would not delay to inform you of this for your curiosity and judgment. The Bill will not be brought into our House for some days. Adieu my dear Brother. I am,
&c. Geoege Grenville.
MR. GRENVILLE TO EARL TEMPLE
November 21, 1766
My dear Brother, � As I thought that in the present critical situation you would be impatient to hear from time to time how things go on, I desired Mrs. Grenville to write last night to Lady Temple, both because I came home so late that I could not have done it so fully myself, and because in all likelihood a letter from her would go safer, and have a better chance to be unopened, than one from me by the post. I shall send this to your house to-night, from thence to be conveyed by the stage coach to you tomorrow.
Our Bill of Indemnity is to be brought in on Mon day, and we then propose to move for the printing it, and fixing a day for reading it a second time, which probably will be on Wednesday, or, at latest, Thursday.
I am assured, that with regard to the preamble the Court will give way, and that they intend in it to assert the illegality of the measure in point of law; but the advisers are not to be included, and if so, we shall be able to enter into the whole debate, upon an instruction to the Committee to insert them, to be moved at the second reading. At all events, I think we shall certainly find some ground on which we shall differ, and be able to gall them with the repetition of this odious subject.
As to the state of parties, there are many marks which show them to be in a great ferment. Lord Edgecumbe dismission for Mr. John Shelley has exasperated the friends of Lord Rockingham, who had a meeting the night before last to consider what to do, and the news of this day is, that they are determined to resign, particularly Mr. Conway, who, it is asserted, has had a very angry interview with Lord Chatham, and says publicly that he knew nothing of Lord Edgecumbe's dismission. The Duke of Grafton says, as we are told, that he would have stopped it if he could, and Lord Shelburne likewise disclaims it, so that the whole of it is laid at Lord Chatham's door. I have no great faith myself in these general resignations, notwithstanding they are so positively asserted, but the air of discontent does certainly appear very strongly among them. Lord Bute's friends still manifest the same, or rather greater, dissatisfaction than when you went out of town.
Sir Gilbert Elliot and Mr. Dyson spoke very fully against the legality, on Tuesday; and Sir Fletcher Norton, Mr. Wedderburn, Mr Thurlow, and almost every lawyer, with all the judges, as is said, but one or two, hold the same language. The lawyers, and almost all our friends, were gone out of the House on Tuesday, when Mr. Alderman Beckford thought proper to adopt the doctrines of his friends and patrons in the House of Peers, so that we beat them with their own troops.
Lord Northington, I hear, swears like a trooper, that we "know nothing of the constitution in the House of Commons, but that this is Bute's villainy; and that he will go to the King and tell him so." The other sage of the law, the Lord Chancellor, says "that men are mad, and that they may force him to submit, but that his doctrines are good law, and that he will maintain them."
Lord Chatham is said to complain of Lord Bute, and to declare that either he or Lord Bute's friends
must go out.
The Duke of Bedford is gone out of town, as you know, but Mr. Rigby came to me the night before last, and assured me in the strongest terms, that they had not had the least intercourse either directly or indirectly with Lord Chatham, since he left Bath. He said, that he and all the Duke of Bedford's friends would support me to the utmost upon this occasion; that he was going into the country for two days, but would stay if I chose it, and promised to return to town on Sunday. He said he was confident that the Duke of Bedford would come up on purpose from Woburn, if I wished it. His language in general and in particular was as open and explicit as possible. Suspend, therefore, your belief of the reports about them 'till you see further1. I have writ to Lord Suffolk, to apprize him of this state, and will write to the Earl of Bucks. Adieu, my dear Brother, ever yours, &c, &c. George Grenville.
MR, GRENVILLE TO THE DUKE OF BEDFORD
May 29, 1767
My dear Lord, � I have had a long conversation with Lord Mansfield, who has but this moment left me. I found him quite unapprized of the contents of the Bill for regulating the East India Company's dividends; but after much talk upon the subject of it, he seemed to be perfectly satisfied that the right way would be to restrain the East India Company's dividends to 12 per cent. during the two years of our intended agreement with that Company, instead of the present Bill to restrain them to 10 per cent. 'till the next session of Parliament.
This has always been my idea, and has not only been agreeable to the sentiments of the proprietors from the beginning of this Bill, but I understand is what they were ready to have adopted in their general Court today. We both agreed in thinking that if an offer to that effect were made in the Company's petition to the House of Lords, it would put the question upon the strongest ground.
As Lord Mansfield's opinion appeared to tally so much with my own upon the merits and substance of the Bill itself, we did not at all enter into the political or party consideration of it; and if your Grace shall see him, I should think it advisable to decline that topic entirely, as I believe there will be no sort of occasion for it; and I am convinced it was that which hurt him in the conversation with the Duke of Newcastle, of which I did not take the least notice, agreeably to the hint in your letter, nor of anything that passed between your Grace and me, except that I had the honour of waiting upon you last night.
I have this moment heard from my wife, who comes from Lady Charlotte Edwin, that Mr. Keck1 was seized with an apoplexy to-day on the course at Epsom, and that he is since dead, which I think it right to give you this early notice of, that if you judge it proper you may apprize the Duke of Marlborough of it, with respect to the borough of Woodstock.
I understood from Lord Mansfield that he proposes to go out of town to-morrow, so that if you wish to see him it will be necessary to send to him early. I am, my dear Lord, &c, &c, Geoege Grenville.
MR. GRENVILLE TO MR. WHATELY
July 12, 1767
Dear Whately, � I came hither from Wotton last night, and return thither to-morrow morning. I found your two packets on my arrival on Friday night at Wotton, and Mr. Lloyd gave me a third from you dated yesterday. Mr. Rigby, whom I found at Wotton on Friday, went to Woburn yesterday, and came over hither this morning, and is now returned again to Woburn.
Lord Rockingham came there yesterday to dinner, and intends to stay 'till this evening or to-morrow morning, when he goes back to London. Lord Temple and I have had a long conversation with Mr. Rigby, which concluded as amicably as is possible, and I have every reason to believe that my friends at Woburn are in the kindest and fairest dispositions towards me. My opinions upon all public business are the same as you have long known them. As to measures, what I have seen confirms me in them. As to arrangements with regard to persons and places, I wish to see one made which is likely to have credit, ability and permanency, and in which my friends may find an honourable place, but for my own part, I would upon no account be obtruded by any one upon the King, nor shall my pretensions be a bar to any establishment which shall be for the public advantage.
An enlarged and united system is the only one which can be so, and if disorder of every kind, both at home and in our colonies, has been the consequence of instability and disunion, the properest means to assert the sovereignty of the kingdom is an Administration built on a strong basis. This is my sense and language at this time, and I believe that of the wisest and honestest men in this country. I am glad to find it universally adopted among all those whom I have seen or heard from, and this, I am told, is the language and determination of Lord Rockingham. I do not find that any specific proposition has yet been made. With regard to myself, I have insisted with Mr. Rigby that my name shall not be mentioned for any office whatsoever, but I sincerely wish that my friends may be properly placed, and if that can be done consistently with those principles we have adopted, and without breaking us to pieces, it will on all accounts be the happiest event that can befall me, and the most beneficial to the public My being in office would only give jealousy to many, and throw difficulties in the way even if things are well intended, without my having the real means to enforce anything, whereas my friends taking post in Government would probably be some restraint to what is wrong, and a support to what is right. I am sure if I can meliorate the situation of my friends instead of sacrificing their just pretensions, myself to go into a great office, the change will be happy, both for my own ease, honour, and the public welfare. I am, &c, &c, George Grenville.
