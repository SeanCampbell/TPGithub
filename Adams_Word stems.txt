PREFACE., THE, art, and, sciences,, in, general,, dure, the, three, or, four, last, centuries,, have, had, a, regular, cours, of, progress, improvement., The, invent, in, mechan, arts,, the, discoveri, in, natur, philosophy,, navigation,, and, commerce,, and, the, advanc, of, civil, and, humanity,, have, occas, chang, in, the, condit, of, the, world,, and, the, human, character,, which, would, have, astonish, the, most, refin, nation, of, antiquity., A, continu, of, similar, exert, is, everi, dai, render, Europ, more, and, more, like, on, community,, or, singl, family., Even, in, the, theori, and, practic, of, government,, in, all, the, simpl, monarchies,, consider, improv, have, been, made., The, check, and, balanc, of, republican, govern, have, been, in, some, degre, adopt, by, the, court, of, princes., By, the, erect, of, variou, tribunals,, to, regist, the, laws,, and, exercis, the, judici, power, �, by, indulg, the, petit, and, remonstr, of, subjects,, until, by, habit, thei, ar, regard, as, right, �, a, controul, ha, been, establish, over, minist, of, state,, and, the, royal, councils,, which, approaches,, in, some, degree,, to, the, spirit, of, republics., Properti, is, gener, secure,, and, person, liberti, seldom, invaded., The, press, ha, great, influence,, even, where, it, is, not, expressli, tolerated;, and, the, public, opinion, must, be, respect, by, a, minister,, or, hi, place, becom, insecure., Commerc, begin, to, thrive:, and, if, religi, toler, were, established,, and, person, liberti, a, littl, more, protected,, by, give, an, absolut, right, to, demand, a, public, trial, in, a, certain, reason, time, �, and, the, state, invest, with, a, few, more, privileges,, or, rather, restor, to, some, that, have, been, taken, awai, �, these, govern, would, be, brought, to, as, great, a, degre, of, perfection,, thei, would, approach, as, near, to, the, charact, of, govern, of, law, and, not, of, men,, as, their, natur, will, probabl, admit, of., In, so, gener, a, refinement,, or, more, properli, reform, of, manner, and, improv, in, knowledge,, is, it, not, unaccount, that, the, knowledg, of, the, principl, and, construct, of, free, governments,, in, which, the, happi, of, life,, and, even, the, further, progress, of, improv, in, educ, and, society,, in, knowledg, and, virtue,, ar, so, deepli, interested,, should, have, remain, at, a, full, stand, for, two, or, three, thousand, years?, �, Accord, to, a, stori, in, Herodotus,, the, natur, of, monarchy,, aristocracy,, and, democracy,, and, the, advantag, and, inconveni, of, each,, were, as, well, understood, at, the, time, of, the, neigh, of, the, hors, of, Darius,, as, thei, ar, at, thi, hour., A, varieti, of, mixtur, of, these, simpl, speci, were, conceiv, and, attempted,, with, differ, success,, by, the, Greek, and, Romans., Representations,, instead, of, collections,, of, the, peopl, �, a, total, separ, of, the, execut, from, the, legisl, power,, and, of, the, judici, from, both, �, and, a, balanc, in, the, legislature,, by, three, independent,, equal, branch, �, ar, perhap, the, three, onli, discoveri, in, the, constitut, of, a, free, government,, sinc, the, institut, of, Lycurgus., Even, these, have, been, so, unfortunate,, that, thei, have, never, spread:, the, first, ha, been, given, up, by, all, the, nations,, except, one,, who, had, onc, adopt, it;, and, the, other, two,, reduc, to, practice,, if, not, invented,, by, the, English, nation,, have, never, been, imit, by, ani, other, except, their, own, descend, in, America., While, it, would, be, rash, to, say,, that, noth, further, can, be, done, to, bring, a, free, government,, in, all, it, parts,, still, nearer, to, perfect, �, the, represent, of, the, peopl, ar, most, obvious, suscept, of, improvement., The, end, to, be, aim, at,, in, the, format, of, a, repres, assembly,, seem, to, be, the, sens, of, the, people,, the, public, voice:, the, perfect, of, the, portrait, consist, in, it, likeness., Numbers,, or, property,, or, both,, should, be, the, rule;, and, the, proport, of, elector, and, member, an, affair, of, calculation., The, durat, should, not, be, so, long, that, the, deputi, should, have, time, to, forget, the, opinion, of, hi, constituents., Corrupt, in, elect, is, the, great, enemi, of, freedom., Among, the, provis, to, prevent, it,, more, frequent, elections,, and, a, more, gener, privileg, of, voting,, ar, not, all, that, might, be, devised., Divid, the, districts,, diminish, the, distanc, of, travel,, and, confin, the, choic, to, residents,, would, be, great, advanc, toward, the, annihil, of, corruption., The, modern, aristocraci, of, Holland,, Venice,, Berne,, &c., have, temper, themselv, with, innumer, multitud, of, checks,, by, which, thei, have, given, a, great, degre, of, stabil, to, that, form, of, government:, and, though, liberti, and, life, can, never, be, there, enjoi, so, well, as, in, a, free, republic,, none, is, perhap, more, capabl, of, profound, sagacity., We, shall, learn, to, prize, the, check, and, balanc, of, a, free, government,, and, even, those, of, the, modern, aristocracies,, if, we, recollect, the, miseri, of, Greec, which, aros, from, their, ignor, of, them., The, onli, balanc, attempt, against, the, ancient, king, wa, a, bodi, of, nobles;, and, the, consequ, were, perpetu, alterc, of, rebellion, and, tyranny,, and, butcheri, of, thousand, upon, everi, revolut, from, on, to, the, other., When, the, king, were, abolished,, the, aristocraci, tyrannized;, and, then, no, balanc, wa, attempt, but, between, aristocraci, and, democracy., This,, in, the, natur, of, things,, could, be, no, balanc, at, all,, and, therefor, the, pendulum, wa, for, ever, on, the,

the, nobl, to, themselves,, and, thei, would, overturn, everi, monarchi, in, Europe,, in, a, few, years,, and, erect, aristocracies., It, is, becom, a, kind, of, fashion, among, writers,, to, admit,, as, a, maxim,, that, if, you, could, be, alwai, sure, of, a, wise,, active,, and, virtuou, prince,, monarchi, would, be, the, best, of, governments., But, thi, is, so, far, from, be, admissible,, that, it, will, for, ever, remain, true,, that, a, free, govern, ha, a, great, advantag, over, a, simpl, monarchy., The, best, and, wisest, prince,, by, mean, of, a, freer, commun, with, hi, people,, and, the, greater, opportun, to, collect, the, best, advic, from, the, best, of, hi, subjects,, would, have, an, immens, advantag, in, a, free, state, more, than, in, a, monarchy., A, senat, consist,
