Two reasons induce me to address the public at present. The one is, to clear a few plain arguments on a matter of the utmost consequence, from the objections lately made against them, in a piece called "The Speech of Joseph Galloway Esq.�. The other is, to answer the unjust accusations contain'd in that piece. 
To act honestly, and to be traduc'd, hath been the fate of many men. To bear slanders with temper, and to entertain a proper pity or contempt, for their weak or wicked authors, has been the lot of few. I will endeavour to imitate their example: and by proposing it to myself, I hope I shall be able so far to suppress the resentment naturally arising from a sense of unprovok'd injuries, that my vindication may be presented not unacceptably, nor uselessly, to candid minds. 
Could I be convinced, that men of sense or virtue, would be persuaded or pleased, by wild declamation or illiberal reflections, I might perhaps be induced to defend myself, in the same shattered style and abusive language, with which I have been attacked: but as these must always offend the wise and good, whose approbation only is worth wishing for, to Mr. Galloway I resign the undisputed glory of excelling in his favorite arts � of writing confusedly and railing insolently. 
Presumptuous indeed must I appear, should I venture into these lists, against a person who wields the weapons of wordy war � the only weapons he dares to wield � with so peculiar a dexterity in his exercise, as to feel no kind of restraint either from sense or truth; the regularity of whose sober discipline would prove, I presume, too great a confinement to this advocate of freedom. 
When I perceived, that Mr. Galloway was hardy enough to obtrude on the public a pretended speech^ of which he never spoke one sentence in the House, I was not surprised to find, that a person who treated his own character with such licence, should not be unsparing of others. But why he should engage in the preposterous project � why he should so industriously endeavour to exhibit me as a villain to my country, for speaking my sentiments in that place where my country had commanded me to speak them � why he has wantonly wounded a man, who never designed or wished him an injury; but has always, as far as his power extended, rendered him all the offices of civility � for what reasons^ I say, he has thus violated the laws of humanity and decency^ his own heart is best able to decide � The public, with which he endeavours to establish his character, by destroying that of another may perhaps be able to guess the secret causes^ by which he has been transported into such unjustifiable excesses of rage and raucour against me � For my part, I shall avoid an enquiry, that would only lead me, I fear, to a painful discovery of the depravity^ to which the human mind is subject.
Leaving then to the impartial world the judgement to be passed on Mr. Galloway'' s conduct � Leaving to him the enjoyment of the solid satisfaction^ that must arise from the meritorious exploit of stabbing publicly a reputation, which has hitherto escaped his insidious attempts I shall endeavour to perform the task imposed on me by his cruelty, and to defend myself from those darts, which with unfriendly hands he has aim'd at my heart. 
When the change of our government, after the adjournment of the assembly in March last, came to be the general subject of conversation, the importance of the measure filled my mind with the greatest anxiety. A severe fit of sickness had prevented my attendance when the resolves were past: but I considered that at the next meeting of the House, the duties of the post which my country had assign'd me, would call upon me to act a part of more consequence, than perhaps would ever fall to my share again, in the whole course of my life. Mindful of the trust committed to me, I endeavour'd to understand a matter on which so much depended. 
I soon perceiv'd, that if a change took place, there were two things to be wish'd for, which there appear'd to me no probability of obtaining. The first was, that the point on which we lately differ'd with the governor, and some others which have been earnestly urg'd by former assemblies, should be determin'd in our favour. The second was, that our privileges should be perfectly secured. 
But insurmountable obstructions seem'd to present themselves, at this time^ against these attempts. "What reasonable hopes of success can we entertain, of having these points decided in our favour, while those ministers who so repeatedly and warmly have approv'd of the proprietors insisting on them, are still in power?" Our danger not only is, that these points will not be decided for us; but, if the proprietors, tired and incensed, should think proper to surrender the government and make their own terms with the crown, is it not highly probable, that they have interest enough to make the change in such a manner as will fix upon us forever those demands which appear so extremely just to the present ministers? Add to this, the "deplorable misfortune under which we now labour, of having incurr'd the displeasure of his majesty and his ministers." These reflections indue' d me to think and to say � that this is not the proper time to attempt a change of our government. 
Mr. Galloway by way of prelude to his answer to these observations, endeavours to shew that I have contradicted myself: but this supposed contradiction is founded on a supposed concession, which I never made � the necessity of a changed My approbation of a change, if we can enjoy all the advantages we now do, is call'd, "a confession that a change is necessary.� But certainly it would have been more natural to construe it as it was intended, and as the sense requires � "that, if we are to lose nothing by the change^ I am as willing to be under the immediate government of the crown, as of the proprietors." 
After this unsuccessful attempt to raise a contradiction, Mr. Galloway takes the trouble of attacking the "inapposite instance," as he calls it, relating to the Duke of Monmouth. This instance was mentioned to confirm a preceding observation; and Mr. Galloway, in attempting to answer it, unluckily for himself points out and enforces the very truth for which it was adduced. But, suppose the duke had waited till the parliament did no longer support the King; but, when they and the whole nation, in the utmost dread of popery and arbitrary power, were looking round with impatient terror for a deliverer, and when many circumstances promised that nobleman success; is it evident that he would not then have succeeded, or that he would have been taken and put to death? Or, if King William had made his attempt, before the nation was properly alarmed, is it certain that the revolution would have been accomplished with such amazing facility? Rashness ruined the one. Caution crowned the other. This is all I intended to prove. 
Mr. Galloway then proceeds, and supposes that all the determinations of the ministry, were mistakes occasioned by proprietary misrepresentations. He then supposes that these determinations were solely owing to the influence of two friends of the proprietors, lately deceased: And lastly, he supposes that now there will be a total alteration in ministerial resolutions. 
These suppositions I acknowledge, are as good securities as any we have, that the grand points controverted between us and the proprietors, will, in any case of a change, be decided in our favour, or that our privileges will be preserved. But still they seem to be too sanguine. Let us remember with what unanimity the ministry at different times have expressed their resentment of our conduct; and, that it is only guess-work to imagine, their resolutions were dictated by two men.
Of one thing we are sure � that we are in the utmost discredit with the king and his ministers. The late resolves prove it. Happy should I be, if I could perceive the least prospect of so great a blessing. 
By what means these prejudices are to be overcome, we are not informed; nor can I conceive. Men of great abilities, and of the most perfect acquaintance with our public affairs, have been employed to remove the force of these misrepresentations, as they are called. Mr. Frankliit and Mr. Charles^ our Agents, spent several years in combating these prejudices; and, even Mr. Galloway himself, as I have been told, elucidated the justice of our cause with his usual perspiaiity in realms of writing. Yet after all these great labours, his majesty and his ministers still retained their former sentiments. 
In confident expectation of these improbabilities, Mr. Galloway is willing to risque the perpetuating those demands, which have been constantly made by the proprietors � at a time^ when we are certain that the crown and its ministers look on these demands as highly just and reasonable. 
One of his arguments for our riding post in this affair is that there are many new colonies to be settled now. 
'Tis true it will convince the emigrants, they are not to have such privileges as were granted to us; or if they have and shall hereafter petition for a change that they will be taken from them. 
But this information, I imagine, will be no discouragement.� There is not the same J reason to grant, nor to wish for privileges now, that existed in the persecuting day of Charles the second. Grants of land on small quit-rents� furnishing the necessaries of life for the first outset�bounties on labour and immunities from taxes for some years � with the common liberties of other English subjects � will do the business, without the privileges of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Galloway before he quits "this wise policy of settling the extensive newly acquired dominions" as he expresses himself, takes the opportunity of making an historical flourish � but unfortunately furnishes "irrefragable demonstrations" that he is utterly unacquainted with the subject, on which he speaks. 
Mr. Franklin read in the House, a short extract from Lord Clarendon's life, relating to Barbados. He refers to Lord Clarendon's life, for this curious anecdote. What then must a man think of Mr. Galloway^ who looks into the book, and finds � that the colony of Barbados did not forfeit any right, that such an opinion was never given � and that there is not a word relating to her charter privileges. Yet this is the truth. 
The fact was this. Charles the first granted the island of Barbados by patent to the earl of Carlisle � he died � his son leased it to lord Willoughby for twenty-one years; appointing him governor, and reserving a moiety of the profits to himself � the civil war broke out � ended � Charles the second was restor'd � there being eight or nine years of lord Willoughby'' s lease to come, he pray'd the king to give him a commission to be governor for that time � But the island was now much changed � it was compleatly settled during the troubles and chiefly by officers of the king�s army � so that now it was of another consideration and value than it had been � the king's customs yearly amounted to a very large sum.
Mr. Galloway endeavours to shew, that the conduct of the proprietors has not been constantly approved by the crown and ministry, because five of the thirteen acts opposed by the proprietors, were confirmed. 
But granting that the riches of the proprietary family shall increase in a greater proportion than the riches of this province � can it be imagin'd, that they will obtain any undue influence over the crown and it's ministers? can it be believed, that the king and parliament will suffer two or three subjects to tyrannise over a dependant colony, in whose welfare Great-Britain is so mucli interested? To reduce us to the most abject state of slavery? 
The supposition is too monstrous to be admitted � and I should be surprized to hear such language from any person, but one who thinks and writes in Mr. Galloway�s shambling way. 
If our proprietors are to become such great and dreadful men � if their influence is to grow superior to justice and reason � I cannot conceive how the king's appointment of governors can secure us from them, any more than his approbation. 
If that influence shall ever be so exorbitant as it has been described, will it not prevail in the nomination of governors? Or in determining their conduct? Can even Mr. Galloway think that the king's appointment will protect us against this influence? If he does, I will answer him in his own words � and if they do not convince him, surely he will not be so unreasonable as to expect, that they should convince any one else. 
This dread of future injuries being removed � or at least the vanity of attempting their removal, on Mr. Galloway'' s own principles being proved � I return to the present situation of affairs. 
It is universally believed, that the present ministry are desirous of vesting the government of this province advantageously in the crown. Mr. Franklin has frequently said it If this be the case, how fair an opportunity is presented to the proprietors of gratifying their resentment, if they entertain any against the province, and securing their interest at the same time by entering into a contract with the crown, and fixing, by an act of parliament, those points in which the ministry have constantly supported them � upon all succeeding ages? 
Many words are unnecessary in so clear a case as this is, Mr. Galloway allows, the proprietors have some sense, and that they understand their own interest. The sentiments of the ministry have been declared in their favor. From thence I think it may be taken for granted, that the proprietors either will not consent to a change � or that their consent will be founded on a perfect security given them for their demands, which appear so just to the king and ministry. What may facilitate this measure is, the proposal of the assembly � * "that 2l full equivalent "be made to the proprietors" upon their parting with the government. How far these words may be construed to extend, will appear from this consideration. With the approbation of the crown the proprietors now insist on certain points which, in their opinion, tend to promote their interests. This, the authority vested in them at present, enables them to do. If they are divested of this authority, without any stipulations for securing their interests hereafter as well as they are at this time it will be said that a full equivalent is not made for the power they resign. This security will therefore without doubt, be required � and that requisition may not appear so unreasonable in Great-Britain as it does here. 
This full equivalent comprehends something more than the settlement of these points. The government of itself is very valuable � and surely we shall not desire the king to pay the equivalent out of his own pocket. If the change therefore is made, I don't question but it will be thought highly reasonable � that we should pay for the blessing which we so earnestly request. 
The situation of our affairs being such as has been described, I could not perceive any necessity "impelling" us to seize this unhappy period, to plunge this province into convulsions, that might while she was thus disordered, be attended with the worst consequences. A gentler remedy appeared to me a properer remedy. 
By no means! What I desire, is, vigorously to oppose those demands; and to try the force of that influence, Without RiSQuiNG Too Much In The Contest. 
I Therefore made a proposal to the House, of a very moderate nature,I had the pleasure of finding highly approved by a gentleman, whose acknowledged integrity, patriotism, abilities, and experience will always give weight to his sentiments, with every impartial person. The proposal was � "that we should desire his majesty's judgment, on the point that occasioned the late unhappy difference between the two branches of the legislature," By taking this step, we should have discovered the sense of the ministry on our late disputes � on other important points which have been controverted with our governors � and respecting our privileges. 
Thus we should have known what success would attend us in any future attempt to effect a change � and what method would be most agreeable to his majesty. But in the present mode of proceeding we have acted with great zeal, I grant � but we are quite ignorant what the event will be, and whether the censures bestowed on the proprietors, may not be thought in Great Britain to be aimed through them^ at the king. In short, we embark in an enterprize of the highest importance; and then look about us to see how it may be carried on. Instead of wandring through a storm in the dark, with so sacred a charge in our custody � I thought it would have been better to have waited, 'till the tempest was a little abated � or, at least, to have procured some light to guide us through the surrounding dangers. 
I shall now consider the manner in which the present attempt to change our government is made. 
Mr. Galloway makes this general objection with great warmth to my arguments, that they are conjectural and "suppositious." 
His resentment was to be expected. How absurd must the language of diffidence appear to one, who never doubted � the force of his own sagacity? To one who, 
castigated, but not convinced, by a discovery of his repeated errors still dares to decide positively in things he does not understand � and drives boldly through public affairs^ like a magnanimous bug* through the blaze that has so often scorcht its wings � how contemptible in his eyes, must be the man, who modestly pursues a train of enquiry, on the unformed events of futurity � and in his researches after truth, admits a possibility of her 
escaping him? 
Mr. Galloway with a spirit of divination, unassisted by the common modes of reasoning � penetrates into the region of contingencies � and fixes with infallible confidence the uncertainties of the times to come, � Far different was the method, which the humble subject of his wrath and reproaches found it proper to pursue. Filled with anxious fears for the welfare of his country � hesitating and apprehensive � it was his endeavour to form a judgment of things that may hereafter happen, from an attentive consideration of present circumstances and past transactions � the only methods to be practised by those whose disquisitions are not aided by such �active blood� as Mr. Galloway�s to whom hesitation appears ridiculous, and apprehension absurd! And no wonder � for if any mistake is committed, all the injury that follows, is � only the trifling loss of the Privileges of Pennsylvania. 
But though Mr. Galloway pierces through with fit is somewhat remarkable, that Mr. Galloway should with anger make an objection to my arguments, that must in the opinion of every person but himself, operate with equal force against his own. Are not his arguments "conjectural and suppositious?" What proof is there, that any thing will be determined, according to his presumptions and guesses? 
By way of explanation and introduction to what I said on the manner of this attempt, it was premised � that some event, arising from the circumstances of the proprietary family, or an act of the crown, might hereafter present us with a more happy method of vindicating our rights and privileges than the present. Upon this Mr. Galloway very gravely runs into a calculation of the lives of the proprietors and their families � and proves to his own satisfaction^ that their descendants even they and every of them will always be wicked and cunning. One virtue, however, he must allow them, to take off the force of my observation � and that is � a most oftcommon harmony among themselves. Yet, after spending four pages on this curious digression, Mr. Galloway himself must grant � that some act of the crown, or a multitude of proprietors (as it happened in Carolina)^ or a dissention between them, tho' few, will be such a circumstance as will produce the conjuncture I mentioned. But I will waive these probabilities. I will indulge Mr. Galloway so far as to suppose they are too uncertain or remote to be expected or regarded. What will this concession prove? That none of those occurrences will afford a favourable mode of making the attempt. But does it prove the present mode to be a good one? or that any necessity is so urgent as to force us to make use of it tho� a bad one. By no means ! If I should see a man about to pass a broad, deep* river, over which I had reason to think he could not swim, would it be an unwise or an unkind act in me to advise him to walk along the bank, and endeavour to find a bridge, or a narrower or shallower place � tho' I had no certainty that there was such a bridge or such a place? Or would this be acknowledging that he was under a necessity of passing the river? My advice would at least have a chance of saving him, and could do him no harm � for, after being disappointed in his search, he might return to the spot where I found him � and would be at liberty to drown himself at last. 
Mr. Galloway mixes all points so confusedly together, that he not only leads himself into a variety of errors, but renders it very difficult for another, in answering, to reduce into any order what he has so loosely scattered about 
This I shall, however, endeavour to do. 
Had he attended to the objections against the manner of the present attempt, he might have perceived that they were three. The first was � that the circumstances attending this proceeding might cause others to attribute it to such passions as are always disgraceful to public councils and destructive to the honor and welfare of a people. It certainly will be admitted that all reproaches of this kind ought to be carefully guarded against � especially by a dependent colony whose conduct has been frequently and severely reprehended.
Mr. Galloway^ however, usurps, in his private room, among his chairs and tables, the absurd license of railing at me on this occasion for speaking my sentiments with freedom � tho' I spoke in a public council � as the representative of a free people � on a subject in which their reputation and happiness were intimately concerned. Any man who thinks, will instantly perceive � that it was my duty to mention everything that I apprehended would tend to secure these blessings. When the assembly was deliberating on a step that seemed to me likely to bring discredit and loss upon us, would it have become me to have suppressed my opinion? No! But it would have pleased Mr. Galloway and some others � Great reward for having been a villain! 
In like manner they mention the point lately controverted. Very well! The contents of the resolves are now proved � But there still remains one point slipped over in silence � Why were these resolves now made? The increase of public houses had frequently been complained of before. � Commissions during good behaviour have always been wished for. � The establishment of a military force has been often attempted in the midst of war, when it was vastly more necessary than at this time. � But never 'till now has there been an attempt to change the government. More observations I think unnecessary. Impartial persons who read the messages and resolves � and consider some other circumstances generally known � will be able to discover the True Cause of the present attempt � and to judge whether it may be justly attributed to passion of any kind. If his majesty and his ministers, whose present opinion of us is allowed to be extremely unfavorable, should be induced by our late behaviour to think us a rash, turbulent people � it will be a misfortune to be deplored by all lovers of their country. 
The second objection against the manner of proceeding, was the inconsistency in which we should be involved. This inconsistency is twofold. In the first place, our dissention with the governor, and this extraordinary attempt in consequence of it, may be thought by the king and the ministry to have arisen on a matter already determined by the crown. Hence our unwillingness to comply with the royal pleasure signifyed to upon this head may be called a very improper foundation of a request "to be more immediately subjected to the royal pleasure." But this objection is easily obviated by supposing that the king and ministry will exactly agree with the assembly in construing the controverted stipulation. I sincerely hope they may; as our construction appears to me extremely reasonable and equitable. But, of this agreement in sentiments I desired to have some proof before we proceeded any further. We have frequently been disappointed in our warmest expectations. In public as well as in private life, he that never doubts, will often be wrong. 
In this second place � there appeared to me an inconsistency in requesting a change of government from the king � and yet insisting on the preservation of privileges derogatory of the royal rights. 
We certainly prefer in our minds one of these things to the other. � Either to continue as we are � or to change, tho' we lose our privileges. If his majesty will not accept of the government in the same state in which it has been, held by the proprietors, what shall be our choice? I don't imagine that even Mr. Galloway tho' he ventures to say *"We have no cause to dread a change if all my fears should prove realities," will dare to propose a direct renunciation of our rights. Trifling as he seems to think them � willing as he is to expose them to hazard on guesses and surmises � they are yet held in too much veneration by the good people of Pennsylvania � for him to declare his contempt of them. If then his majesty shall be so �unreasonable� as to insist upon exercising his authority, in case of a change, as fully in this province as in any other under his immediate government, � and we insist that he shall not ; the bargain breaks off � "and the worst consequence is (according to Mr. Galloway) that we must then remain (as I would have us remain) in our present situation." A much worse consequence, in my opinion, will follow. May we not again be reproached with double dealing and deceit? � The assembly's petition to the crown draws a high coloured picture of our present distresses. � But let me suppose Mr. Galloway deputed to plead the public cause � an office which I have some reason to think would, by no means, be disagreeable to him! If the royal ear is not deaf " � if it will hear� � these are the pleasing � the descriptive � and convincing strains, in which "that Ear" will be addressed. 
This expression is strictly agreeable to Mr. Galloway's argument. � For if the corruption of the people in this province is one reason of his desiring a change, he must say we are more corrupt than his majesty's subjects in the rest of his dominions; otherwise we request a government under which the people are as bad as ourselves ; and, therefore, the change can be no service to us. 
Thus, by requesting a change^ we lay ourselves under the inevitable necessity, either of quietly giving up our rights and privileges, in order to maintain a consistency in our conduct; or of incurring the severe censure above mentioned � unless the king will be so good natur�d in consideration of the infinite pains we have taken to recommend ourselves to his favor � as to be contented with the sane share of power in this province; which his two subjects Thomas and Richard Penn now have. 
No person can surrender what he has not. This term, therefore, when applied to the people of Pennsylvania means a giving up of the peculiar rights derived to them under their charter. 
They can not surrender what belongs to others � and therefore their act can not take away the rights of the proprietors. But should the proprietors, enraged at our behaviour, and fatigued with disputes, make their own terms with the crown, and give up the royal charter � then the surrender may be said to be compleated. 
I will not pursue this point any farther. I will suppose in Mr. Galloway's favour, that what he calls his speech was so long, and took so much time in making, that he forgot in forming one part, what he had written in another. 
To attend him still farther in his political rambles, for some respect is due, to be sure, to f '*one of the happy instruments of relieving his country," and its "long supporter," I will grant out of complaisance to him, in order to give his argument its fullest force^ that he has told a great many falsehoods � that we are not in the deplorable condition he has represented us � and that our liberties, rights and privileges which he has taken so much pains to blast, are still fresh and flourishing. 
Why then (says he) it will be unjust in the king and parliament to deprive us of them; and we have "irrefragable proofs" of the justice of the house of commons, because in the years 1718 and 1748, they would not pass an act to give royal instructions the force of laws in America. 
Thus he concludes, that because the house of commons would not make the king absolute monarch of North America^ which would have been injurious to the rights of Great Britain � THEREFORE, they will not allow him to exercise in one province that authority, which he exercises in every other part of his dominions. Truly an uncommon, but not a very syllogistical method, of arguing!
Let Mr. Galloway when he shall be employed in "supporting the expiring liberties of his country," step into the British senate � and endeavour to convince them of this injustice. 
How will our deputy extricate himself from this dilemma? If we are more happy, why do we desire a change � or why does Mr. Galloway talk of the "expiring liberties of his country?" If we are less happy � why do we dread it? Why are we unwilling to become in every respect like those who are happier than ourselves? Or where is the injustice of placing us in the same situation. 
Before I quit this point, I must make one observation more, to shew by Mr. Galloway�s contradiction of himself (though I am almost tired with taking notice of his contradictions) that notwithstanding the rage with which he has asserted the contrary � he really thinks our privileges will be indangered, if the parliament should take the change of our government into their consideration.
He employs many pages to prove there is no danger tho' the affair should come before the parliament.
Thus he acknowledges, that the house of assembly, in making the present attempt, have endeavoured to avoid a parliamentary enquiry, because the rights of the people would be involved in it, to the danger of owi privileges. � 
Upon the whole that has been said with regard to a change � and the safety or the danger of the measure I thus conclude. 
If it cannot be accomplished � the manner in which it has been attempted will load this province with new disgrace. If it is accomplished, we are utterly ignorant how it will be. The fate of our privileges, and the great points controverted between us and the proprietors, are now to be everlastingly determined. Many unhappy circumstances attend us in the enterprize. 
Here then I fix the argument. On this point I rely. Whatsoever may be the force of the reasonings on either side � however probable or improbable the success may be � yet after placing everything in the strongest light against myself � it must be granted � that the event is undoubtedly uncertain � and that the persons desiring a change know no more^ what will be the consequences � than they know what will be the figure of next year's clouds. 
A measure in which the happiness of so many thousands is involved, ought not therefore to have been pursued in so hasty and unguarded a manner. Precautions should have been taken. Securities should have been obtained. This was � this is � my firm opinion � and should a change be happily obtained, without injuring a single privilege, or settling a single point against us � should the conduct of the assembly and the people in this affair be intirely approved by his majesty and his ministers � I shall always rejoice � that I was not concerned in exposing the inestimable interests of my country to Hazard, 
With equal scorn do I behold him, who endeavours to recommend himself, either to men of power ^ or to the public by flattering their passions or errors, and by forfeiting his honor and integrity. 
The good man who is guided through life by his conscience and reason, may in particular instances^ offend even honest and wise men � but his virtue will naturally produce an unifortnity in his conduct upon the whole^ that will discover his probity, and procure him the general approbation of the worthy. 
The duke of Sully being a Protestant, was appointed by his master, Henry the fourth oi France, to preside in a general assembly of the Protestants, which was called to meet at Chatcllerant. . . . The duke was their faithful friend through his whole life, and strictly attached to them by principle; but the warmth of their temper led them in to many things, in this assembly, in which he could not join with them . . . without offering violence to his own sentiments . . . and integrity . . . 
To support the attrocious charge he has made against me, Mr. Galloway produces no kind of proof � except my differing in opinion from him, be proof. But if this be admitted, then Mr. Norris^ Mr. Richardson and the two other gentlemen who difiered from him, are villains also, influenced by the same views, attributed to me. 
This would be too daring a charge, and more difficult perhaps for Mr. Galloway to support, than to crush by calumnies and conspiracies^ a young man, who has excited more than one passion in more than one man's breast. 
Had I intended to recommend myself to the government, I certainly might have given the sentiments I delivered in the House a more courtier-like air than they now bear. Had I intended this, I should not have been one of the first and warmest to declare my fixed resolution not to admit of the governor's construction of the stipulation he disputed with us ; nor should I have steadily persisted in this opposition to the last. 
One thing more I beg leave to mention, since Mr. Galloway compels me to speak of myself. I was appointed to carry the bill to the governor the second time for his assent, after he had once refused it. This was long before the change of government was talked of. On my delivering it, some conversation arose between us on the subject, Mr. Shippen the secretary, being present. As the passage of the bill was of the utmost importance to his majesty's service and the good of the public, I took the liberty, though my acquaintance with the governor was very slight, of mentioning several reasons to prove that the assembly's construction of the disputed stipulation was extremely equitable ; consistent with the established rules of explaining a sentence capable of two meanings ; and, therefore, ought to be admitted � and that his honour's conduct in passing the bill, as it then was framed, would not be disapproved of in England. I further added, that I was persuaded his refusal would throw everything into the greatest confusion.
Being soon after taken ill and confined to my room, so anxious was I to prevent any difference at that time be- tween the governor and assembly that I sent for a gentleman, whom I knew to be intimately acquainted with the governor; and urging everything I could think of to convince him that our bill ought to be passed as we had formed it, I entreated him to go to the governor, and endeavour to prevail on him to give his assent. 
I hope this cannot be called the conduct of a man influenced by �mischievous passions destructive of public liberty." 
Another charge brought against me by Mr. Galloway is, that I neglected my duty of attending in the House, and never spoke my sentiments till it was too late. 
Mr. Galloway's behaviour in making this charge, is a plain proof to what lengths he will proceed, in hopes of injuring me. The first time, since I have been a representative of this province, that a change of government was mentioned and debated in the assembly, was on Saturday the 24th day of March last, on the governor sending down to them his message absolutely refusing to pass the supply bill, unless the stipulation was literally complied with. That day^ the assembly's answer was composed and sent � the frequent motions, with the "solemn debate" Mr. Galloway talks of, made � the resolves past � and the House adjourned to the 14th of May. 
Mr. Galloway must be conscious that this day, and the day before, I was confined to my chamber, and mostly to my bed, by a sincere attack of the fever and ague. He knows, that on the Thursday before, I was so ill, that there not being a sufficient number of members without me^ those who were met, intended to come and sit at my house; and that to save the gentlemen this trouble, I determined to wait on them^ and was carried up in the late speaker's chariot, which he was so kind as to send for me, it being a rainy day. 
This state of my health at that time, being a fact well known to many persons, and particularly to Mr. Galloway how cruel and unjust is it to blame me for not attending, when it was impossible � and when, if it had been possible, I had not the least suspicion that anything of such vast importance would come into consideration. 
On the meeting of the House, the 14th day of last May according to their adjournment, I constantly attended every day, untill this important matter was determined, except on Monday, the 21st � on which day there was no House, only eighteen members meeting, Mr. Galloway and many others being absent. The following days the petition for a change came in � were read � as other petitions were � lay on the table � and not a word spoken on the subject. 
Thus business went on till Wednesday^ the 23d, when I was prevented for the first time from attending the House by a fever � which, as it was very injurious to my health, would also, if Mr. Galloway'' s charitable and humane wishes could prevail, prove destructive to my reputation. This day the matter was started. In vain did the speaker recommend the deferring to take any resolution till the House was more full � and the absent members, then in town could attend. � He desired that the affair might be put off to the next day � in vain � the debate was begun � quickly determined � a committee appointed to prepare a draught of the petition � that draught made � brought in � presented � read � 
The next day, tho' still extremely indisposed, I attended � and was surprised to find so much business of the utmost consequence had been done in so short a time � and though I could have wished that such a step had not been taken, without allowing me, and every other member, of whose attendance there was any probability^ an opportunity of offering our sentiments; yet I comforted myself with reflecting, that though it had been resolved, "that a petition should be drawn," yet it was not resolved "that any petition should be presented," and that I should be at liberty to offer my opinion hereafter. I was determined therefore to attend diligently; and to take the first opportunity which would be on the second reading of the petition, to oppose it. This I was induced to do, by considering, that if I did not say any thing, till the question was put for transcribing^ or signing in order to be presented, it would look very odd for me to be silent so long, and that it would answer no purpose. 
Accordingly, on the second reading of the petition, which was the first opportunity I ever had^ since the change of government was attempted, I spoke against it. 
The only objection then made by Mr. Galloway and every other member who spoke on the occasion, was � that I had offered my sentiments too soon to the House � and that I should have staid for the question to transcribe or sign the petition. 
That I did not act with any stupid and useless reserve in lying by till this time, was never dreampt of by any member who knew, why I had been detained at home, whenever I was detained. 
How vain is his attempt who strives to please all men? Or indeed to please one man at all times? Mr. Galloway and others said, that I spoke too soon. He and some more now say, I spoke too late. Why too late? Were not my arguments as well understood then^ and had they not the same force as if they had been used before? And if they proved the measure to be dangerous and improper ought they not in a matter of such importance to the public to have been as much regarded, as if they were one day older? 
If this affair had not been so quickly decided I never should have been charged with omitting to speak in time. But I must not quit Mr. Galloway. What must the public think of a man who dares to abuse them by the grossest deceptions, with the pious intention of injuring another? 
Yet the candid Mr. Galloway knows � that there never was any debate in the assembly, since I have been a member, respecting the change of government � until that which issued in the resolve to adjourn � and that I was then ill.
This account of the time when every transaction passed in the house � and of my attendance, is taken from the minutes of assembly, and the book for entring the attendance of the members � both which I have carefully looked 
over, in the presence of Dr. Moore the clerk, who therefore is perfectly acquainted with the truth of every thing I have averred. 
I acknowledge myself guilty of taking some pains to put my thoughts into order, and that my notes were long and exact, that I might thereby be enabled to deliver my sentiments with clearness. I regarded this as a duty, upon an occasion where such an interesting subject was to be discussed � and I was encouraged to use this mode � because I once before had used it, and received such public praises from the present speaker, for introducing a method, highly commended, and the next day, imitated by him, as afforded me the sincerest pleasure � and I hope, will serve to counsole me, ballancing the calumny with which I am loaded, because I would not go Through with measures which my conscience and reason commanded me to oppose 
Mr. Galloway also accuses me of having promised him a copy of my speech, and of not performing my promise. Here he is egregiously mistaken. I told him he should have the copy that night it was delivered, if I could get it ready. The house broke up late in the evening. He soon after called upon me. It was not ready. He told me it would be too late^ if he had it not soon. I did not then understand his meanings as I did not in the least apprehend, the most important matter that ever came before the house of assembly, was to be decided with less deliberation than is generally bestowed on things of much slighter moment. Next morning I took the copy to the House in my pocket. No one called for it. I did the same in the afternoon. The like silence was observed. I did not chuse to shew any forwardness in forcing it on those who seemed willing to forget it. Had I acted otherwise, I should have been called impudent and conceited, by those who are fond of bestowing epithets. 
As to the last part of this whimsical charge, I shall not pretend to give any answer; because that would be in some measure allowing Mr. Galloway capable of judging, what is a "deliberate manner" of speaking. 
As to the first part � any man but Mr. Galloway would have discovered why I began to speak, without recurring to my notes. The resolves were past � and the petition ordered to be drawn in my absence. I never had heard the change spoke of in the house � and did not know but by information of others, the reasons by which the members had been influenced. Before I offered my sentiments, it was therefore necessary for me to discover the arguments that would be used against me. On the information I had received, I had prepared my answer; but to make this answer appear with propriety, I thought it requisite to have the arguments of those who desired a change, repeated before the house. I threw out general objections; and desired to know what reasons could be tho't sufficient to engage the house in so hazardous a measure? Then the "judicious and sensible members" Mr. Galloway mentions, and he among them � for that phrase, I suppose, is his way of complimenting himself� discovered all the arguments on which they relied. � They proved to be the same I expected; and I "retreated to my speech," which was 
prepared to answer them. 
Here he is again mistaken. The printed speech is exactly the same with that I pronounced, except the corrections and additions I made to compleat the sense, the evening before it was to be delivered to the Members, as is above mentioned � and except some slight alterations in a few places. I father declare^ that I have not received the least assistance from any person in composing and correcting it; not even so much as the addition of a single word; and that no man ever saw it, or knew that I had written it, except my clerk, who transcribed it � untill it was delivered in the House. 
As to the preface, it makes no �demonstration� that can affect me. Finding that Mr. Galloway and his emissaries were traducing me in every company, and misrepresenting every thing I had said � I thought these aspersions might be removed, by laying before the public, the reasons by which I had been induced to act as I did. This consideration had the more weight with me, on receiving a letter from some gentlemen in this city, desiring a copy of the speech. 
They being my constituents � and men of the clearest characters, I thought it my duty to comply with their request. I sent a copy to them � and they had it printed with such a title, and in such a manner, as they thought proper, without even consulting me; which could not conveniently be done as I was out of town. � For immediately after delivering the copy, I was obliged to go into the country for my health. I went to the Jerseys. While I was there, the preface was written, and printed. I never was made acquainted with its contents, till it was published. I do not even know at this time who wrote it, but by common report.
Every thing I have said on these last heads, is known to be true, by my friends; whose virtue and good opinion I too much revere, to appeal to them as witnesses, if I was not conscious of the sincerity with which I speak. 
Thus have I faithfully laid before the public, my whole conduct relating to the change of our government, and the reasons on which it was founded. If sensible and good men approve of my behaviour, I quit without regret the applauses of others, and all the attendant advantages, to those, who think proper to court them.
