THOUGHTS ON AMERICAN LIBERTY.
The Congress is, properly speaking, the representative of the great body of the people of North America. Their election is for a particular purpose, and the particular season only; it is quite distinct from the assemblies of the several provinces. What will be before them, is quite different from what was or could be in the view of the electors, when the assemblies were chosen. There for those provinces are wrong, who committed it to the assembly as such, to send delegates, though in some provinces, such as Boston and Virginia, and some others, the unanimity of sentiment is such, as to make it the same thing in effect.
It is at least extremely uncertain, whether it could be proper or safe for the Congress to send either ambassadors, petition or address, directly to king the parliament, or both. They may treat them as a disorderly, unconstitutional meeting � they may hold their meeting itself to be criminal � they may find so many objections in point of legal form, that is plainly in the power of those who wish to be able to do it, to deaden the zeal of the multitude in the colonies, by ambiguous, dilatory, frivolous answers, perhaps severer measures. It is certain that this Congress is different from any regular exertion, in the accustomed forms of a quiet, approved, settled constitution. It is an interruption or suspension of the usual forms, and an appeal to the great law of reason, the first principles of the social union, and the multitude collectively, for whose benefit all the peculiar laws and customs of a constituted state, are supposed to have been originally established.
There is not the least reason as yet, to think that either the king, the parliament, or even the people of Great Britain, have been able to enter into the great principles of universal liberty, or are willing to hear the discussion of the point of right, without prejudice. They have not only taken no pains to convince us that submission to their claim is consistent with liberty among us, but it is doubtful whether they expect or desire we should be convinced of it. It seems rather that they mean to force us to be absolute slaves, knowing ourselves to be such by the hard law of necessity. If this is not their meaning, and they with us to believe that our properties and lives are quite safe in the absolute disposal of the British Parliament, the late acts with respect to Boston, to ruin their capital, destroy their charter, and grant the soldiers a licence to murder them, are certainly arguments of a very singular nature.
Therefore it follows, that the great object of the approaching Congress should be to unite the colonies, and make them as one body, in any measure of self-defense, to assure the people of Great Britain that we will not submit voluntarily, and convince them that it would be either impossible or unprofitable for them to compel us by open violence.
For this purpose, the following resolutions and recommendations are submitted to their consideration: �
1. To posess as all the provincial and county rulers have done, our loyalty to the king, and our backwardness to break our connexion with Great Britain, if we are not forced by their unjust impositions. Here it may not be improper to compare our past conduct with that of Great Britain itself, and perhaps explicitly to possess our detestation of the virulent and insolent abuse of his majesty�s person and family, which so many have been guilty of in that island.
2. To declare, not only that we esteem the claim of the British parliament to be illegal and unconstitutional, but that we are firmly determined never to submit to it, and do deliberately prefer war with all its horrors, and even extermination itself to slavery, rivetted on us and our posterity.
3. To resolve that we will adhere to the interest of the whole body, and that no colony shall make it separate piece, or from the hope of partial distinction, we�ve others as victims of ministerial vengeance, but that we will continue United, and pursue the same measures, till American liberty is settled on a solid basis, and in particular till now suffering colony of Massachusetts Bay is restored to all the rights of which it has been, on this occasion, unjustly deprived.
4. That a non-importation agreement, which is been too long delayed, should be entered into immediately, and at the same time, a general non-consumptive agreement, as to all British goods at least, should be circulated universally through the country, and take place immediately, that those who have retarded the non-importation agreement, may not make a profit to themselves by this injury to their country.
5. That some of the most effectual measures should be taken to promote, not only industry in general, but manufacturers in particular; such as granting premiums in different colonies for manufacturers which can be produced in them; appointing public markets for all the materials of manufacture; inviting over and encouraging able manufacturers in every branch; and appointing societies in every great city, especially in principle sea-ports, to receive subscriptions for directing and encouraging emigrants who shall come over from Europe, whether manufactures or laborers, and publishing proposals for this purpose, in the British newspapers.
6. That it be recommended to the legislature of every colony, to put their militia upon the best footing; and to all Americans to provide themselves with arms, in case of a war with the Indians, French or Roman Catholics, or in case they should be reduced to the hard necessity of defending themselves from murder and assassination.
7. That committee should be appointed to draw up an earnest and affectionate address to the army and navy, putting them in mind of their character as Britons, the reproach which they will bring upon themselves, and the danger to which they will be exposed, if they allow themselves to be instruments of enslaving their country.
8. Better plan of union should be laid down for all the colonies, so that, as formerly, they may correspond and ascertain how they shall effectually co-operate in such measures as shall be necessary to their common defense.


On the Contest between Great Britain and America 
Philadelphia, September 3, 1778.
Dear Sir,
Your very acceptable letter of 21st March, I received about the middle of June, and would have answered it long ago, Sarah did any encouraging prospect of conveying it safely. As to writing you a short letter that must have gone open through the enemy�s posts, I did not think it worthwhile. I have however now come to a resolution of writing you pretty fully, and trying to convey it by France or Holland; and if it should fall into their hands, and never get to your�s, there will be no other loss than my time and writing; for as to any other consequences, either to the public or to myself, I have not the least apprehension.
Your letter came to me sealed, and apparently never opened, in a packet from the British commissioners, which arrived at York-town while the congress was setting; and consequently it, as well as one from Mr. F �, was delivered to me presence of the whole members. As the same packet, besides the public message, contain some private letters and address to particular members, some of them from Gov. Johnstone, one of the commissioners, the proposal was made by a member, who read publicly one received by himself, that every gentleman who had received private letters from any person with the enemy, should deliver them to Congress, that they might be read. This would have been attended with no difficulty as to me; except some family affairs in Mr. F ��s letter very improper to be publicly red, and some expressions in his letter a little offensive speaking of congress. However, it was not done at that time; and afterwards, in a diet at many days distance, every member would receive any such letters, was called upon to read from them related to public affairs, which was done.
I am and have been greatly concerned, as you seem to be, The contest between Great-Britain and America; and certainly, for my own interest, have by far the greatest reason of the two; and in as I suppose it will be agreeable to you, shall make a few observations, 1. Upon the public cause, and 2. On my own conduct, China understand for many different quarters, to be highly blamed in my native country.
As to the public cause, I look upon the separation of America from Britain to be the visible intention of Providence; and believe that in the issue it will be to the benefit of this country, without any injury to the other � perhaps to the advantage of both. It seems to me the intention of Providence for many reasons, which I cannot now enumerate, but in a particular manner for the following � that I cannot recollect any instance in history, in which a person or people have so totally and uniformly mistaken the means for attaining their own ends, as the king and parliament in Britain have in this contest. I do seriously and positively affirm to you, my dear sir, that is my opinion, the Congress itself, if they had been to direct the measures of the British ministry, could not or would not have directed them to measures so effectual to forward and establish the independence of America, as those which they chose of their own accord. They have had a mistaken opinion of the state of things in America, from the beginning to this our, and have founded their own conduct upon their mistakes. They supposed sometimes, that the people of America in general were seditious and factious � Desirous of a Separation from Great-Britain, and that their conduct on occasion of the stamp-act was the effect of this disposition. Nothing could be more untrue. I am a witness that the people of this country had an esteem of, and attachment to the people of Great-Britain, exceedingly strong. They were proud of them, and of their own dissent from them. British fashions, British goods, and even British persons, were in the highest esteem. A person educated in the old countries had a degree of rank and credit from that circumstance, independent of every other. I think they were even partial in this respect. I believe, have myself been born and educated in America, I should have met with a degree of acceptance and success in my station, far inferior to what actually happened. When an American spoke of going to England, he always called it going home; and where ever you are in this country, you meet with almost nothing but counties, townships and houses, called by English names. I live at Princeton in Middlesex county; and on the opposite side of the street is Somerset county, and indeed I believe all the counties in New-Jersey, are called by English names.
From this I desire that you may infer, that the opposition made to the claims of parliament, arose from a deep and universal conviction in the people, that they were inconsistent with their own security and peace. In this I am satisfied that they judge right; for had the claims set up been acquiesced in, the provincial assemblies would have become contemptible and useless, and the whole colonies no better than a parcel of tributary states, which, placed at so great a distance, would�ve been, from error, ignorance and self-interest, loaded in the most insupportable manner.
Another mistake, into which the ministry and parliament of England fell, was that this was a deep-laid scheme of a few artful and designing men, who stirred up the multitude for their own ends; that the sentiments in favor of America, will by no means general; but that the artful leaders imposed upon them. This I have seen asserted from the beginning to the end of the quarrel; and to complete the absurdity, the very commissioners now here from Britain, continue to reason in the same manner � impeach the congress with ambitious and designing views, and seemed disposed to appeal to the people. Alas! they know nothing of the matter. The congress is a changeable body: members are going from it, and coming to it every month, may every week.
