  CONNEXION OF GREAT BRITAIN WITH INDIA
  IN order to open more fully the tendency of the policy, which has hitherto prevailed, and that the House may be enabled, in any regulations, which may be made, to follow the tracks of the abuse, and to apply an appropriated remedy to a particular distemper; Your Committee think it expedient to consider, in some detail, the manner, in which India is connected with this kingdom; which is the second head of their plan.
The two great links, by which this connexion is maintained, are, first, the East India Company's commerce; and next, the Government set over the natives by that Company, and by the Crown. The first of these principles of connexion, namely, the East India Company's trade, is to be first considered, not only as it operates by itself, but as having a powerful influence over the general policy and the particular measures of the Company's Government. Your Committee apprehend that the present state, nature, and tendency of this trade, are not generally understood.
Until the acquisition of great territorial revenues by the East India Company, the trade with India was carried on upon the common principles of commerce, namely, by sending out such commodities as found a demand in the India market; and where that demand was not adequate to the reciprocal call of the European market for Indian goods, by a large annual exportation of treasure, chiefly in silver. In some years that export has been as high as fix hundred and eighty thousand pounds sterling. The other European Companies, trading to India, traded thither on the same footing. Their export of bullion was probably larger in proportion to the total of their commerce; as their commerce itself bore a much larger proportion to the British, than it does at this time, or has done for many years past. But stating it to be equal to the British, the whole of the silver sent annually from Europe into Hindostan could not fall very short of twelve or thirteen hundred thousand pounds a year. This influx of money, poured into India by an emulation of all the commercial nations of Europe, encouraged industry, and promoted cultivation in a high degree; notwithstanding the frequent wars, with which that country was harrassed, and the vices, which existed in its internal Government. On the other hand, the export of so much silver was sometimes a subject of grudging and uneasiness in Europe; and a commerce, carried on through such a medium, to many appeared in speculation of doubtful advantage. But the practical demands of commerce bore down those speculative objections. The East India commodities were so essential for animating all other branches of trade, and for compleating the commercial circle, that all nations contended for it with the greatest avidity. The English Company flourished under this exportation for a very long series of years. The Nation was considerably benefited both in trade and in revenue; and the Dividends of the Proprietors were often high, and always sufficient to keep up the credit of the Company's Stock in heart and vigour. 
But at, or very soon after, the acquisition of the territorial revenues to the English Company, the period of which may be reckoned as compleated about the year 1765, a very great revolution took place in commerce as well as in dominion; and it Avas a revolution, which affected the trade of Hindostan with all other European nations, as well as with that, in whose favour and by whose power it was accomplished. From that time bullion was no longer regularly exported by the English East India Company to Bengal, or any part of Hindostan; and it was soon exported in much smaller quantities by any other nation. A new way of supplying the market of Europe, by means of the British power and influence, was invented; a species of trade (if such it may be called), by which it is absolutely impossible that India should not be radically and irretrievably ruined, although our possessions there were to be ordered and governed upon principles diametrically opposite to those, which now prevail in the system and practice of the British Company's Administration.
  A certain portion of the revenues of Bengal has been for many years set apart, to be employed in the purchase of goods for exportation to England, and this is called the�Investment.�The greatness of this Investment has been the standard, by which the merit of the Company's principal Servants has been too generally estimated; and this main cause of the impoverishment of India has been generally taken as a measure of its wealth and prosperity. Numerous fleets of large ships, loaded with the most valuable commodities of the East, annually arriving in England in a constant and increasing succession, imposed upon the publick eye, and naturally gave rise to an opinion of the happy condition and growing opulence of a country, whose surplus productions occupied so vast a space in the commercial world. This export from India seemed to imply also a reciprocal supply, by which the trading capital employed in those productions was continually strengthened and enlarged. But the payment of a tribute, and not a beneficial commerce to that country, wore this specious and delusive appearance.
The fame of a great territorial revenue, exaggerated, as is usual in such cases, beyond even its value, and the abundant fortunes of the Company's Officers, military and civil, which flowed into Europe with a full tide, raised in the Proprietors of East India Stock a premature desire of partaking with their Servants in the fruits of that splendid adventure. Government also thought they could not be too early in their claims for a share of what they considered themselves as entitled to in every foreign acquisition made by the power of this kingdom, through whatever hands, or by whatever means it was made. These two parties, after some struggle, came to an agreement to divide between them the profits, which their speculation proposed to realize in England from the territorial revenue in Bengal. About two hundred thousand pounds was added to the annual Dividends of the Proprietors. Four hundred thousand was given to the State; which, added to the old Dividend, brought a constant charge upon the mixt interest of Indian trade and revenue of eight hundred thousand pounds a year; this was to be provided for at all events.
  By that vast demand on the territorial fund, the correctives and qualifications, which might have been gradually applied to the abuses in Indian commerce and government, were rendered extremely difficult. 
The practice of an Investment from the Revenue began in the year 1776, before arrangements were made for securing and appropriating an assured fund for that purpose in the Treasury, and for diffusing it from thence upon the manufactures of the country in a just proportion, and in the proper season. There was indeed for a short time a surplus of cash in, the Treasury.  It was in some shape to be sent home to its owners. To send it out in silver was subject to two manifest inconveniences: � First, The Country would be exhausted of its circulating medium. A scarcity of coin was already felt in Bengal, Cossim Ali Khan (the Nabob, whom the Company's Servants had lately setup, and newly expelled) during the short period of his power had exhausted the country by every mode of extortion; in his;�flight he carried off an immense treasure, which has been variously computed, but by none at less than three millions sterling. A country so exhausted of its coin and harrassed by three revolutions rapidly succeeding each other, was rather an object, that stood in need of every kind of refreshment and recruit, than one, which could subsist under new evacuations. The next and equally obvious inconvenience was to the Company itself. To send silver into Europe would be to send it from the best to the worst market. When arrived, the most profitable use, which could be made of it, would be to send it back to Bengal, for the purchase of Indian merchandize: it was necessary therefore to turn the Company's revenue into its commerce. The first Investment was about five hundred thousand pounds, and care was taken afterwards to enlarge it. In the years 1767 and 1768 it arose to seven hundred thousand.
This new system of trade, carried on through the medium of power and publick revenue, very soon produced its natural effects. The loudest complaints arose among the natives, and among all the foreigners, who traded to Bengal. It must unquestionably have thrown the whole mercantile system of the country into the greatest confusion. With regard to the natives, no expedient was proposed for their relief. The cafe was serious with respect to European Powers. The Presidency plainly represented to the Directors, that some agreement should be made with foreign nations, for providing their Investment to a certain amount, or that the deficiencies then subsisting must terminate in an open rupture with France. The Directors, pressed by the large payments in England, were not free to abandon their system; and all possible means of diverting the manufactures into the Company's Investment were still anxiously sought and pursued, until the difficulties of the foreign Companies were at length removed by the natural flow of the fortunes of the Company's Servants into Europe, in the manner, which will be stated hereafter.
But, with all these endeavours of the Presidency, the Investment sunk in 1769, and they were even obliged to pay for a part of the goods to private merchants, in the Company's Bonds bearing interest. It was plain that this course of business could not hold. The manufacturers of Bengal, far from being generally in a condition to give credit, have always required advances to be made to them; so have the merchants very generally; at least, since the prevalence of the English power in India. It was necessary therefore, and so the Presidency of Calcutta represented the matter, to provide beforehand a year's advance. This required great efforts, and they were made. Notwithstanding the famine in 1770, which wasted Bengal in a manner dreadful beyond all example, the Investment, by a variety of successive expedients, many of them of  the most dangerous nature and tendency, was forcibly kept up; and even in that forced and unnatural state, it gathered strength almost every year. The debts contracted in the infancy of the system were gradually reduced; and the advances to contractors and manufacturers were regularly made; so that the goods from Bengal, purchased from the territorial revenues, from the sale of European goods, and from the produce of the monopolies, for the four years, which ended with 1780 (when the Investment from the surplus revenues finally closed), were never less than a million sterling, and commonly nearer twelve hundred thousand pounds. This million is the lowest value of the goods sent to Europe, for which no satisfaction is made. 
About an hundred thousand pounds a year is also remitted from Bengal, on the Company�s account, to China; and the whole of the product of that money flows into the direct trade from China to Europe. Besides this, Bengal sends a regular supply, in time of peace, to those Presidencies, which are uneqnal�unequal to their own establishment. To Bombay, tho remittance in money, bills, or goods, for none of which there is a return, amounts to one hundred and sixty thousand pounds a year at a medium. 
The goods, which are exported from Europe to India, consist chiefly of military and naval stores, of clothing for troops,�and of other objects for the consumption of the Europeans residing there; and, excepting some lead, copper utensils and sheet copper, woollen cloth, and other commodities of little comparative value, no sort of merchandize is sent from England, that is in demand for the wants or desires of the native inhabitants.
When an account is taken of the intercourse (for it is not commerce), which is carried on between Bengal and England, the pernicious effects of the system of Investment from Revenue will appear in the strongest point of view. In that view, the whole exported produce of the country (so far as the Company is concerned) is not exchanged in the course of barter; but is taken away without any return or payment whatsoever. In a commercial light, therefore, England becomes annually bankrupt to Bengal, to the amount nearly of its own dealing; or rather, the country has suffered what is tantamount to an annual plunder of its manufactures and its produce to the value of twelve hundred thousand pounds.
  In time of peace, three foreign Companies appear at first�sight to bring their contribution of trade to the supply of this continual drain. These are the Companies of France, Holland, and Denmark. But when the object is considered more nearly, instead of relief, these Companies, who from their want of authority in the country might seem to trade upon a principle merely commercial, will be found to add their full proportion to the calamity brought upon Bengal by the destructive system�of the ruling Power; because the greater part of the capital of all these Companies, and perhaps the whole capital of some of them, is furnished exactly as the British is, out of the revenues of the country. The civil and military Servants of the English East India Company being restricted in drawing bills upon Europe, and none of them ever making or proposing an establishment in India, a very great part of their fortunes, well or ill gotten, is in all probability thrown, as fast as required, into the cash of these Companies.
 In all other countries, the revenue, following the natural course and order of things, arises out of their commerce. Here, by a mischievous inversion of that order, the whole foreign maritime trade, whether English, French, Dutch, or Danish, arises from the revenues; and these are carried out of the country, without producing any thing to compensate so heavy a loss. 
Your Committee have not been able to discover the entire value of the Investment made by foreign Companies. But as the Investment, which the English East India Company derived from its revenues, and even from its publick credit, is for the year 1783 to be wholly stopped, it has been proposed to private persons to make a subscription for an Investment on their own account. This Investment is to be equal to the sum of �800,000. Another loan has been also made for an Investment on the Company's account to China, of��200,000. This makes a million; and there is no question, that much more could be readily had for bills upon Europe. Now, as there is no doubt that the whole of the money remitted is the property of British subjects, (none else having any interest in remitting to Europe), it is not unfair to suppose, that a very great part, if not the whole of what may find its way into this new channel, is not newly created; but only diverted from those channels in which it formerly ran, that is, the cash of the foreign Trading Companies.
  Besides the Investment made in goods by foreign Companies from the funds of British subjects, these subjects have been for some time in the practice of sending very great sums in gold and silver directly to China on their own account. In a Memorial presented to the Governour General and Council, in March 1782, it appears, that the principal money lent by British subjects to one Company of Merchants in China then amounted to seven millions of dollars, about one million seven hundred thousand pounds sterling; and not the smallest particle of silver sent to China ever returns to India. It is not easy to determine, in what proportions this enormous sum of money has been sent from Madras, or from Bengal, but it equally exhausts a country belonging to this kingdom, whether it comes from the one or from the other.
But that the greatness of all these drains, and their effects may be rendered more visible, Your Committee have turned�their consideration to the employment of those parts of the Bengal Revenue, which are not employed in the Company's own Investments for China and for Europe. What is taken over and above the Investment (when an Investment can be made) from the gross Revenue, cither for the charge of collection or for civil and military Establishments, is in time of peace two millions at the least. From the portion of that sum, which goes lo the support of Civil Government, the natives are almost wholly excluded, as they are from the principal collections of Revenue. With very few exceptions, they are only employed as servants and agents to Europeans, or in the inferiour departments of collection, when it is absolutely impossible to proceed a step without their assistance. For some time after the acquisition of the territorial Revenue, the sum of four hundred and twenty thousand pounds a year was paid, according to the stipulation of a treaty, to the Nabob of Bengal for the support of his government. This sum, however inconsiderable compared to the revenues of the province, yet, distributed through the various departments of Civil Administration, served in some degree to preserve the natives of the better fort, particularly those of the Mahomedan profession, from being utterly ruined. The people of that persuasion, not being so generally engaged in trade, and not having on their conquest of Bengal divested the ancient Gentu proprietors of their lands of inheritance, had for their chief, if not their sole support, the share of a moderate conqueror in all offices civil and military. But Your Committee find that this arrangement was of a short duration. Without the least regard to the subsistence of this innocent people, or to the faith of the agreement, on which they were brought under the British Government, this sum was reduced by a new treaty, to�320,000; and soon after (upon a pretence of the present Nabob's minority, and a temporary sequestration for the discharge of his debts) to��160,000: but when he arrived at his majority, and when the debts were paid, the sequestration still continued. And, so far as the late advices may be understood, the allowance to the Nabob appears still to stand at the reduced sum of��160,000.
The other resource of the Mahomedans, and of the Gentus of certain of the higher casts, was the Army. In this Army, nine-tenths of which consists of natives, no native of whatever description holds any rank higher than that of a�Subadar�Commandant,�that is, of an Officer below the rank of an English Subaltern, who is appointed to each Company of the Native Soldiery.
  Your Committee here would be understood to state the ordinary establishment, for the war may have made some alteration: all the honourable, all the lucrative situations of the Army, all the supplies and contracts of whatever species, that belong to it, are solely in the hands of the English; so that whatever is beyond the mere subsistence of a common soldier and some officers of a lower rank, together with the immediate expenses of the English Officers at their table, is sooner or later, in one shape or another, sent out of the country.
Such was the state of Bengal even in time of profound peace, and before the whole weight of the publick charge fell upon that unhappy country for the support of other parts of India, which had been desolated in such a manner as to contribute little or nothing to their own protection.
Your Committee have given this short comparative account of the effects of the maritime traffick of Bengal when in its natural state, and as it has stood since the prevalence of the system of an Investment from the Revenues. But before the formation of that system, Bengal did by no means depend for its resources on its maritime commerce. The inland trade, from whence it derived a very great supply of silver and gold, and many kinds of merchantable goods, was very considerable. � The higher provinces of the Mogul empire were then populous and opulent, and intercourse to an immense amount was carried on between them and Bengal. A great trade also passed through these provinces from all the countries on the frontier of Persia and the frontier provinces of Tartary, as well as from Surat and Baroach on the Western side of India. These parts opened to Bengal a communication with the Persian Gulph and with the Red Sea, and through them with the whole Turkish and the maritime parts of the Persian empire, besides the commercial intercourse, which it maintained with those and many other countries through its own seaports.
During that period, the remittances to the Mogul's treasury from Bengal were never very large, at least for any considerable�time; nor very regularly sent; and the impositions of the State were soon repaid with interest, through the medium of a lucrative commerce. But the disorders of Persia, since the death of Kouli Khan, have wholly destroyed the trade of that country; and the trade to Turkey, by Judda and Bussorah, which was the greatest and perhaps the best branch of the Indian trade, is very much diminished. The fall of the throne of the Mogul Emperours has drawn with it that of the great marts of Agra and Delhi. The utmost confusion of the North-western provinces followed this revolution, which was not absolutely complete, until it received the last hand from Great Britain. Still greater calamities have fallen upon the sine provinces of Rohilcund and Oude, and on the countries of Corah and Allahabad. By the operations of the British arms and influence, they are in many places turned to mere deserts, or so reduced and decayed as to afford very few materials, or means of commerce. 
Such is the actual condition of the trade of Bengal, since the establishment of the British power there. The commerce of the Carnatic, as far as the enquiries of Your Committee have extended, did not appear with a better aspect, even before the invasion of Hyder Ali Khan, and the consequent desolation; which, for many years to come, must exclude it from any considerable part of the trading system. 
  It appears on the examination of an intelligent person' concerned in trade, and who resided at Madras for several years, that, on his arrival there, which was in the year 1767, that city was in a flourishing condition, and one of the first marts in India; but when he left it in 1779, there was little or no trade remaining, and but one ship belonging to the whole place. The evidence of this gentleman purports, that at his first acquaintance with the Carnatic it was a well cultivated and populous country, and as such consumed many articles of�merchandize; that at his departure, he left it much circumscribed in trade, greatly in the decline as to population and culture, and with a correspondent decay of the territorial Revenue.
Your Committee find, that there has also been from Madras an Investment on the Company's account, taking one year with another, very nearly on the fame principles, and with the same effects, as that from Bengal; and they think it is highly probable, that, besides the large sums remitted directly from Madras to China, there has likewise been a great deal on a private account, for that and other countries, invested in the cash of foreign and European Powers trading on the coast of Coromandel. But Your Committee have not extended their enquiries relative to the commerce of the countries dependent on Madras, so far as they have done with regard to Bengal. They have reason to apprehend, that the condition is rather worse; but if the House requires a more minute examination of this important subject, Your Committee is willing to enter into it without delay.
