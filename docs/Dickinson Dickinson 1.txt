The present age has been witness to as great political phenomena, as have appeared in the history of the world. 
Among other events, we have seen America in a dignified progression, from resentment of injuries to remonstrances, from remonstrances to arms, and from arms to liberty � after a vicissitude of fortunes delivered from despotism, and establishing her freedom in a republican form of government, on the pure and just principles of popular representation and federal union delineated in these writings. 
Throughout the course of these contests, the friends of liberty in Great-Britain^ many of them peers or members of the house of commons, of the highest characters, were warm advocates for the justice of our cause. 
In the year 1774, the earl of Chatham^ in a speech worthy of his distinguished talents and illustrious reputation, said � "If we take a transient view of those motives, which induced the ancestors of our fellow subjects in America^ to leave their native country, to encounter the innumerable difficulties of the unexplored regions of the Western world, our astonishment at the present conduct of their descendants will naturally subside. There was no corner of the globe to which they would not have fled, rather than submit to the slavish and tyrannical spirit, which prevailed at that period in their native country; and viewing them in their original, forlorn, and now flourishing state, they may be cited as illustrious instances to instruct the world � what great exertions mankind will make, when left to the free exercise of their own powers. 
In the beginning of the year 1775, soon after the American papers had laid laid before the peers, he made another speech becoming his splendid fame. These were some of his expressions � "This universal opposition to your arbitrary system of taxation, might have been foreseen; it was obvious from the nature of things, and from the nature of man, and above all, from the confirmed habits of thinking, from the spirit of whiggism flourishing in America. The spirit which now pervades America^ is the same which formerly opposed loans, benevolences, and ship-money in this country; is the same spirit which roused all England to action at the revolution, and which established at a remote sera, your liberties, on the basis of that grand fundamental maxim of the constitution, that no subject of England shall be taxed, but by his own consent. 
What political event, in the annals of the world, can be more worthy of being commended to the attention of nations! 
We now behold the sun of liberty illumining Europe; and we have reason to believe, that its rays will reach to other quarters of the globe, beaming with a benign influence on the human race. 
With such knowledge of facts, and with such hopes of the future, every American who loves his country, must be pleased to trace our momentous controversy with Great-Britain., from its commencement in her injustice, to its termination in our independence ; and every friend to mankind must rejoice, in contemplating the actual and probable consequences of our revolution to other nations. 
If this intelligence should be conveyed in narratives, written in coolness and leisure, after the agitation of events had subsided, no doubt it would be agreeable: but, this collection offers to our fellow-citizens, in a series from the beginning of the year 1764, writings composed and published in the midst of the arduous contention, while Britain with insulting pretensions, and relentless cruelties, was practising every artifice, and straining every nerve, by statutes and by swords, to bend or break us into bondage: and the editors think it their right and duty, to insert some testimonies concerning several of these writings, to shew the sentiments that were entertained of them at the times when they were published, or soon after. 
When honest men apprehend their country to be injured, nothing is more natural than to resent and complain: but when they enter into consideration of the means for obtaining redress, the same virtue that gave the alarm, may sometimes, by causing too great a transport of zeal, defeat its own purpose; it being expedient for those who deliberate of public affairs, that their minds should be free from all violent passions These emotions blind the understanding: they weaken the judgment. It, therefore, frequently happens, that resolutions formed by men thus agitated, appear to them very wise, very just, and very salutary; while others, not influenced by the same heats, condemn those determinations, as weak, unjust and dangerous. Thus, Sir, in councils it will always be found useful, to guard against even that indignation, which arises from integrity. 
More particularly are we bound to observe the utmost caution in our conduct, as the experience of many years may convince us, that all our actions undergo the strictest scrutiny. Numerous are the instances, that might be mentioned, of rights vindicated and equitable demands made in the province, according to the opinions entertained here, that in Great Britain^ have been adjudged to be illegal attempts, and pernicious pretensions. 
These adjudications are the acts of persons vested with such dignity and power, as claim some deference from us: and hence it becomes not unnecessary to consider, in what light the* measures now proposed may appear to those, whose sentiments from the constitution of our government, it will always be prudent to regard. 
But on this important occasion, we ought not to aim only at the approbation of men, whose authority may censure and control us. More affecting duties demand our attention. The honor and welfare of Pennsylvania depending on our decisions, let us endeavour so to act, that we may enjoy our own approbation, in the cool and undisturbed hours of reflection: that we may deserve the approbation of the impartial world; and of posterity who are so much interested in the present debate. 
No man. Sir, can be more clearly convinced than I am of the inconveniences arising from a strict adherence to proprietary instructions. We are prevented from demonstrating our loyalty to our excellent Sovereign, and our affection to our distrest fellow-subjects, unless we will indulge the Proprietors, with a distinct and partial mode of taxation, by which they will save perhaps four or five hundred pounds a year, that ought to go in ease of our constituents. 
This is granted on all sides to be unequal; and has, therefore, excited the resentment of this House. Let us resent � but let our resentment bear proportion to the provocation received ; and not produce, or even expose us to the peril of producing, effects more fatal than the injury of which we complain. If the change of government now meditated, can take place, with all our privileges preserved, let it instantly take place : but if they must be consumed in the blaze of royal authority, we shall pay too great a price for our approach to the throne ; too great a price for obtaining (if we should obtain) the addition of four or five hundred pounds to the proprietary tax; or, indeed, for any emolument likely to follow from the' change. I hope I am not mistaken when I believe that every member in this House feels the same reverence that I do for these inestimable rights. When I consider the spirit of liberty that breathes in them, and the flourishing state to which this province hath risen in a few years under them, I am extremely desirous that they should be transmitted to future ages ; and I cannot suppress my solicitude while steps are taking that tend to bring them all into danger. Being assured that this House will always think an attempt to change this government too hazardous, unless these privileges can be perfectly secured^ I shall beg leave to mention the reasons by which I have been convinced that such an attempt ought not now to be made. 
It seems to me, sir, that a people who intend an innovation of their government ought to chuse the most proper time^ and the most proper method^ for accomplishing their purposes; and ought seriously to weigh all the probable and possible consequences of such a measure. 
There are certain periods in public affairs when designs may be executed much more easily and advantageously than at any other. It hath been by a strict attention to every interesting circumstance, a careful cultivation of every fortunate occurrence, and patiently waiting till they have ripened into a favourable conjecture, that so many great actions have been performed in the political world. 
It was through a rash neglect of this prudence, and too much eagerness to gain his point, that the Duke of Monmouth destroyed his own enterprise and brought himself dishonourably to the block, though everything then verged towards a revolution. The Prince of Orange, with a wise delay pursued the same views and gloriously mounted a throne. 
It was through a like neglect of this prudence that the commons of Denmark^ smarting under the tyranny of their nobility, in a fit of revengeful fury suddenly surrendered their liberties to their king; and ever since, with unavailing grief and useless execrations, have detested the mad moment which slipt upon them the shackles of slavery, which no struggles can shake off. With more deliberation^ the Dutch erected a stadholdership, that hath been of signal service to their state. 
That excellent historian and statesman, Tacitus^ whose political reflections are so justly and universally admired, makes an observation in his third annal that seems to confirm these remarks.
If then. Sir, the best intentions may be disappointed by too rapid a prosecution of them, many reasons induce me to think, that this is not the proper time to attempt the change of our government. 
It is too notorious and too melancholy a truth, that we now labor under the disadvantage of royal and ministerial displeasure. The conduct of this province during the late war, has been almost continually condemned at home. We have been covered with the reproaches of men, whose stations give us just cause to regard their reproaches. The last letters from his majesty's secretary of state prove, that the reputation of the province has not yet revived. We are therein expressly charged with double dealing, disrespect for his Majesty's orders, and in short, accusations, that shew us to be in the utmost discredit. Have we the least reason to believe, when the transactions of this year and the cause of our application for a change, are made known to the king and his ministers, that their resentment will be waived? Let us not flatter ourselves. Will they not be more incensed when they find the public service impeded, and his majesty's dominions so long exposed to the ravages of merciless enemies, by our inactivity and obstinacy, as it will be said? For this, I think, hath been the constant language of the minority on the like occasions. Will not their indignation rise beyond all bounds when they understand that our hitherto denying to grant supplies, and our application for a change, proceed from the governor's strict adherence to the terms of the stipulations, so solemnly made, and so repeatedly approved, by the late and present King?
But I may perhaps be answered, "that we have agreed to the terms of the stipulations, according to their true meaning, which the governor refuses to do." Surely, Sir, it will require no slight sagacity in distinguishing, no common force of argument, to persuade his Majesty and his Council, that the refusal to comply with the true meaning of the stipulations proceeds from the Governor, when he insists on inserting in our bill the very words and letters of those stipulations. 
I grant it appears so to us^ but much I doubt whether his Majesty's Council will be of the same opinion. That Board and this House have often differed as widely in their sentiments. Our judgment is founded on the knowledge we have of facts, and of the purity of our intentions. The judgment of others^ is founded on the representations made to them of those facts and intentions. 
These representations may be unjust; and, therefore, the decisions that are formed upon them may be erroneous. If we are rightly informed, we are represented as the mortal enemies of the proprietors, who would tear their estates to pieces unless some limit was fixed to our fury. For this purpose the second and third articles of the stipulations were formed. The inequality of the mode was explained and enlarged upon by the provincial counsel; but in vain. I think, I have heard a worthy member who lately returned from England mention these circumstances. 
If this be the case, what reasonable hope can we entertain of a more favourable determination nowf The Proprietors are still living. Is it not highly probable that they have interest enough, either to prevent the change or to make such terms as will fix upon us forever those demands that appear so extremely just to present Ministers? One of the Proprietors appears to have great intimacy and influence with some very considerable members of his Majesty's Council. Many men of the highest character, if public reports speak truth, are now endeavouring to establish proprietary governments, and, therefore, probably may be more readily inclined to favour proprietary measures. The very gentlemen who formed the articles of the stipulations are now in power^ and, no doubt, will inforce their own acts in the strictest manner. On the other hand, every circumstance that now operates against us, may in time turn it our favour. We may, perhaps, be fortunate enough, to see the present prejudices against us worn off; to recommend ourselves to our Sovereign and to procure the esteem of some of his ministers. I think I may venture to assert that such a period will be infinitely more proper than the present, for attempting a change of our government. 
With the permission of the House, I will now consider the manner in which this attempt is carried on; and I must acknowledge that I do not in the least degree approve of it. 
The time may come when the weight of this government may grow too heavy for the shoulder of a subject, at least too heavy for those of a woman, or an infant The proprietary family may be so circumstanced as to be willing to accept of such an equivalent for the government from the crown, as the crown may be willing to give. Whenever this point is agitated, either on a proposal from the crown or proprietors, this province may plead the cause of her privileges with greater freedom and with greater probability of success than at present. The royal grant, the charter founded upon it, the public faith pledged to the adventurers for the security of those rights to them and their posterity, whereby they were encouraged to combat the dangers, I had almost said, of another world; to establish the British power in remotest regions, and add inestimable dominions with the most extensive commerce to their native country; the high value and veneration we have for these privileges, the afflicting loss and misfortune we should esteem it, to be deprived of them, and the unhappiness in which his Majesty's faithful I subjects in this province would thereby be involved; our inviolable loyalty and attachment to his Majesty's person and illustrious family, whose sovereignty hath been so singularly distinguished by its favourable influence on the liberties of mankind. � All these things may then be properly insisted on. If urged with that modest heart-felt energy, with which good men should always vindicate the interests of their country, before the best of sovereigns, I should not despair of a gracious attention to our humble requests. Our petition in such a case, would be simple, respectful and perhaps affecting. 
But in the present mode of proceeding, it seems to me, that we preclude ourselves from every office of decent duty to the most excellent of Kings, and from that right of earnestly defending our privileges, which we should otherwise have. The foundation of this attempt, I am apprehensive, will appear to others, peculiarly unfortunate. In a sudden passion, it will be said, against the Proprietors, we call out for a change of government. Not from reverence for his Majesty, not from a sense of his paternal goodness to his people, but because we are angry with the Proprietors, and tired of a dispute founded on an order approved by his Majesty and his royal grandfather.
Our powerful friends on the other side of the Atlantic who are so apt to put the kindest constructions on our actions, will, no doubt.
But here it will be said, nay it has been said, and the petition before the House is drawn accordingly, "we will not alledge this dispute with the Governor on the stipulations, but the general inconveniences of a proprietary government as the cause of our desiring a change." 'Tis true we may act in this artful manner, but what advantages shall we gain by it? Though we should keep the secret, can we seal up the lips of the Proprietors? Can we recall our message to the Governor? Can we annihilate our own resolves? Will not all � will not any of these discover the true cause of the present attempt? 
Why, then, should we unnecessarily invite fresh invectives in the very beginning of a most important business, that, to be happily concluded, requires all the favour we can procure and all the dexterity we can practice? 
We intend to surround the throne with petitions that our government may be changed from proprietary to royal: at the same time we mean to preserve our privileges : but how are these two points to be reconciled? 
If we express our desire for the preservation of our privileges, in so general or faint a manner as may induce the King to think they are of no great consequence to us, it will be nothing less than to betray our country. 
If, on the other hand, we inform his Majesty "that though we request him to change the government, yet we insist on the preservation of our privileges," certainly it will be thought an unprecedented stile of petitioning the crown, that humbly asks a favour and boldly prescribes the terms on which it must be granted. 
How then shall we act? Shall we speak, or shall we suppress our sentiments? The first method will render our request incoherent : the second will render it dangerous. Some gentlemen are of opinion that these difficulties may be solved by intrusting the management of this affair to an Agent; but I see no reason to expect such an effect. 
I would first observe that this matter is of too prodigious consequence to be trusted to the discretion of an Agent. But if it shall be committed by this House, the proper guardian of the public liberties^ to other hands, this truth must at some time or other be disclosed: "that we will never consent to a change unless our privileges are preserved." I should be glad to know with what finesse this matter is to be conducted. Is the agent to keep our petition to the crown in his pocket till he has whispered to the ministry? Will this be justifiable? Will it be decent? Whenever he applies to them^ I presume, they will desire to know his authority for making such an application. Then our petition must appear; and whenever it does appear, either at first or last, that^ and the others transmitted with it, I apprehend, will be the foundation of any resolutions taken in the King's Council. 
Thus, in whatever view this transaction is considered, shall we not still be involved in the dilemma already mentioned, "of begging a favour from his Majesty's goodness, and yet showing a distrust that the royal hand, stretched out at our own request for our relief, may do us an injury?"
Let me suppose, and none can offer the least proof of this supposition being unreasonable, that his Majesty will not accept of the government, clogged, as it will be said, with privileges inconsistent with the royal rights: how shall we act then? We shall have our choice of two things: one of them destructive, the other dishonourable. 
We may either renounce the laws and liberties framed and delivered down to us by our careful ancestors : or we may tell his Majesty with a surly discontent, "that we will not submit to his implored protection^ but on such conditions as we please to impose on him." Is not this the inevitable and dreadful alternative, to which we shall reduce ourselves? 
In short, Sir, I think the farther we advance in the path we are now in, the greater will be the confusion and danger in which we shall engage ourselves. Any body of men acting under a charter, must surely tread on slippery^ ground when they take a step that may be deemed a sure render of that charter. For my part, I think the petitions that have been carried about the city and country to be signed, and are now lying on the table, can be regarded in no other light than as a surrender of the charter, with a short indifferent hint annexed of a desire that our privileges may be spared if it shall be thought proper. Many striking arguments may, in my opinion, be urged, to prove that any request made by this House for a change may, with still greater propriety be called a surrender. The common observation "that many of our privileges do not depend on our charter only, but are confirmed by laws approved by the Crown," I doubt will have but little weight with those who will determine this matter. 
It will readily be replied, "that these laws were founded on the charter; that they were calculated for a proprietary government, and for no other, and approved by the Crown in that view alone; that the proprietary government is now acknowledged by the people living under it to be a bad government, and the Crown is intreated to accept a surrender of it: that, therefore, by abolishing the proprietary government, everything founded upon it must of consequence be also abolished." 
However, if there should be any doubts in the law on these points, there is an easy way to solve them. 
These reflections. Sir, naturally lead me to consider the consequences that may attend a change of our government, which is the last point I shall trouble the House upon at this time. 
It is not to be questioned, but that the Ministry are desirous of vesting the immediate government of this Province advantageously in the Crown. Tis true, they don't chuse to act arbitrarily, and tear away the present government from us without our consent. This is not the age for such things. But let us only furnish them with a pretext, by pressing petitions for a change; let us only relinquish the hold we now have, and in an instant we are precipitated from that envied height where we now stand. The affair is laid before the Parliament, the desires of the Ministry are insinuated, the rights of the Crown are vindicated, and an act passes to deliver us at once from the government of Proprietors, and the privileges we claim under them. 
Then, Sir, we, who in particular have presented to the authors of the fatal change this long-wished for opportunity of effecting it, shall, for our assistance be entitled to their thanks � Thanks which I am persuaded every worthy member of this House would abhor to deserve and would scorn to receive.
It seems to be taken for granted that by a change of government we shall obtain a change of those measures which are so displeasing to the people of this Province � that justice will be maintained by an equal taxation of the proprietary estates � and that our frequent dissentions will be turned into peace and happiness. 
These are effects indeed sincerely to be wished for by every sensible, by every honest man; but reason does not always teach us to expect the warm wishes of the heart. Could our gracious Sovereign take into consideration the 
state of every part of his extended dominions, we might expect redress of every grievance; for with the most implicit conviction, I believe he is as just, benevolent and amiable a Prince as heaven ever granted in its mercy to bless the people. I venerate his virtues beyond all expression. But his attention to our particular circumstances being impossible, we must receive our fate from ministers; and from them I do not like to receive it. 
We are not the subjects of ministers; and, therefore, it is not to be wondered at if they do not feel that tenderness for us that a good prince will always feel for his people. Men are not born ministers. Their ambition raises them to authority, and when possessed of it, one established principle with them seems to be, "never to deviate from a precedent of power." 
Did we not find in the late war, though we exerted ourselves in the most active manner in the defence of his Majesty's dominions, and in promoting the service of the Crown, every point in which the Proprietors thought fit to make any opposition, decided against us? Have we not also found, since the last disturbance of the public peace by our savage enemies, the conduct of the late Governor highly applauded by the ministry, for his adherence to those very stipulations now insisted on, and ourselves subjected to the bitterest reproaches^ only for attempting to avoid burthens, that were thought extremely grievous. 
Other instances of the like kind I pass over to avoid a tedious recapitulation. 
Since then the gale of ministerial favour has in all seasons blown propitious to proprietary interests, why do we now fondly flatter ourselves that it will suddenly shift its quarter? Why should we with an amazing credulity now fly for protection to those men, trust everything to their mercy, and ask the most distinguishing favours from their kindness, from whom we complained a few months ago that we could not obtain the most reasonable requests? Surely, Sir, we must acknowledge one of these two things: either, that our complaint was then unjust^ or, that our confidence is now unwarranted. For my part, I look for a rigid perseverance in former measures. With a new government I expect new disputes. The experience of the royal colonies convinces me that the immediate government of the Crown is not a security for that tranquility and happiness we promise ourselves from a change. It is needless for me to remind the House of all the frequent and violent controversies that have happened between the King's Governors in several provinces and their Assemblies. At this time, if I am rightly informed, Virginia is struggling against an instruction relating to their paper currency,* that will be attended, as that colony apprehends, with the most destructive consequences if carried into execution. 
Indeed, Sir, it seems vain to expect, where the spirit of liberty is maintained among a people, that public contests should not also be maintained. Those who govern^ and those who are governed^ seldom think they can gain too much on one another. Power is like the ocean^ not easily admitting limits to be fixed in it. It must be in motion. Storms, indeed, are not desirable, but a long dead calm is not to be looked for, perhaps, not to be wished for. Let not then, in expectation of smooth seas and an undisturbed course^ too rashly venture our little vessel that hath safely sailed round our own well known shores, upon the midst of the untrod deep without being first fully convinced that her make is strong enough to bear the weather she may meet with, and that she is well provided for so long and so dangerous a voyage. 
No man. Sir, amongst us hath denyed, or will deny, that this Province must stake on the event of the present attempt, liberties that ought to be immortal � Liberties founded on the acknowledged rights of human nature and restrained in our mother-country, only by an unavoidable necessity of adhering in some measure to long-established customs. Thus hath been formed between old errors and hasty innovations an entangled chain, that our ancestors either had not moderation or leisure enough to untwist. 
I will now briefly enumerate, as well as I can recollect, the particular privileges of Pennsylvania. 
In the first place, we here enjoy that best and greatest of all rights, a perfect religious freedom. 
Posts of honour and profit are unfettered with oaths or tests^ and, therefore are open to men whose abilities, strict regard to their conscientious persuasion, and unblemished characters qualify them to discharge their duties with credit to themselves and advantage to their country. Thus justice is done to merit, and the public loses none of its able servants. 
The same wisdom of our laws has guarded against the absurdity of granting greater credit even to villains, if they will swear, than to men of virtue, who from religious motives cannot. Therefore, those who are conscientiously scrupulous of taking an oath, are admitted as witnesses in criminal cases. Our legislation suffers no checks from a council instituted in fancied imitation of the House of Lords. By the right of sitting on our own adjournments, we are secure of meeting when the public good requires it: and of not being dismist when private passions demand it. At the same time, the strict discharge of the truth committed to Us, is inforced by the short duration of our power, which must be renewed by our constituents every 
year. 
Nor are the people stript of all authority in the execution of laws. They enjoy the satisfaction of having some share, by the appointment of provincial commissioners, in laying out the money which they raise, and of being in this manner assured that it is applied to the purposes for which it was granted. They also elect sheriffs and coroners, officers of so much consequence in every determination that affects honour, liberty, life or property. 
Let any impartial person reflect how contradictory some of these privileges are to the most ancient principles of the English constitution, and how directly opposite other of them are to the settled prerogatives of the crown, and then consider what probability we have of retaining them on a requested^ change: that is of continuing in fact a proprietary government, though we humbly pray the King to change this government. Not unaptly, in my opinion, the connection between the proprietary family and this Province may be regarded as a marriage. Our privileges may be called the fruits of that marriage. The domestic peace of this family, it is true, has not been unvexed with quarrels and complaints. But the pledges of their affection ought always to be esteemed: and whenever the parents on an imprudent request shall be divorced^ much I fear that their issue will be declared illegitimate. This I am well persuaded of, that surprizing must our behaviour appear to all men, if in the instant when we apply to his Majesty for relief from what we think oppression, we should discover a resolute disposition to deprive him of the uncontroverted prerogatives of his royal dignity. 
At this period when the administration is regulating new colonies, and designing, as we are told, the strictest reformatio7is^ in the old, it is not likely that they will grant an invidious distinction in our favour. Less likely is it, as that distinction will be liable to so many, and such strong constitutional objections ; and when we shall have the weight both of the clergy and ministry, and the universally received opinions of the people of our mother country to contend with. 
I mean not, Sir, the least reflection on the church of England. I reverence and admire the purity of its doctrine and the moderation of its temper. I am convinced that it is filled with learned and with excellent men: but all zealous persons think their own religious tenets the best, and would willingly see them embraced by others. 
I, therefore, apprehend that the dignified and reverend gentlemen of the church of England will be extremely desirous to have that church as well secured, and as much distinguished as possible in the American colonies: especially in those colonies where it is overborne, as it were, by dissenters. There never can be a more critical opportunity for this purpose than the present. The cause of the church will besides be connected with that of the crown, to which its principles are thought to be more favourable than those of the other professions. 
We have received certain information that the conduct of this Province, which has been so much censured by the ministry, is attributed to the influence of a society, that holds warlike measures at all times to be unlawful. We also know that the late tumultuous and riotous proceedings, which are represented in so strong a light by the petition, now before the House, have been publicly ascribed to the influence of another society. Thus the blame of everything disreputable to this province is cast on one or the other of these dissenting sects. Circumstances that, I imagine, will neither be forgot nor neglected. 
We have seen the event of our disputes concerning the Proprietary interests ; and it is not to be expected that our success will be greater when our opponents become more numerous, and will have more dignity, more power, and, as they will think, more law on their side. 
These are the dangers, Sir, to which we are now about to expose those privileges in which we have hitherto so much gloried. Wherefore? To procure two or three, perhaps four or five hundred pounds a year (for no calculation has carried the sum higher), from the Proprietors, for two or three or four or five years, for so long and something longer, perhaps, the taxes may continue. 
But are we sure of gaining this point? We are not. Are we sure of gaining any other advantage? We are not. Are we sure of preserving our privileges? We are not. Are we under a necessity of pursuing the measure proposed at this time? We are not. 
Here, Sir, permit me to make a short pause. Permit me to appeal to the heart of every member in this House, and to entreat him to reflect how far he can be justifiable in giving his voice, thus to hazard the liberties secured to us by the wise founders of this Province; peaceably and fully enjoyed by the present age, and to which posterity is so justly entitled. 
But, Sir, we are told there is no danger of losing our privileges if our government should be changed, and two arguments are used in support of this opinion. The first is, "That the government of the Crown is exercised with so much lenity in Carolina and the Jerseys.'''' I cannot perceive the least degree of force in this argument. As to Carolina^ I am not a little surprized, that it should be mentioned on this occasion, since I never heard of one privilege that colony enjoys more than all the royal governments in America. The privileges of the Jerseys are of a different nature from many of which we are possest; and are more consistent with the royal prerogative. 
Indeed I know of none they have, except that * Quakers may be witnesses in criminal cases, and may bear offices. Can this indulgence shewn to them for a particular reason, and not contradictory to the rights of the crown, give us any just cause to expect the confirmation of privileges directly opposite to those rights, and for confirming which no such reason exists. But, perhaps, the gentlemen who advance this argument mean that we shall purchase a change at a cheap price if we are only reduced to the same state with the Jerseys. Surely, Sir, if this be their meaning, they entirely forget those extraordinary privileges which some time ago were mentioned. 
How many must we in such a case renounce? I apprehend it would prove an argument of little consolation to these gentlemen if they should lose three-fourths of their states, to be sold, that they still remain as rich as their neighbors, and have enough to procure all the necessaries of life. 
It is somewhat remarkable that this single instance of favour, in permitting an affirmation instead of an oath, in a single province, should be urged as so great an encouragement to us, while there are so many examples of another kind to deter us. In what royal government besides the Jerseys can a Quaker be a witness in criminal cases, and bear offices? What can be the reason of this distinction in the Jerseys? Because in the infancy of that colony, when it came under the government of the crown, there was, as appears from authentic vouchers, an ABSOLUTE NECESSITY from the scarcity of other proper persons, to make use of the people called Quakers in public employments. Is there such a necessity in this Province? Or can the ministry h^ persuaded that there is such a necessity ? No, Sir, those from whom they will receive information will grant no such thing; and, therefore, I think there is the most imminent danger^ in case of a change, that the people of this society will lose the exercise of those rights, which, though they are entitled to as men, yet such is the situation of human affairs, they with difficulty can find a spot on the whole globe where they are allowed to enjoy them. It will be an argument of some force, I am afraid, that the church of England can never expect to raise its head among us, while we are encouraged, as it will be said, in dissension; but if an oath be made necessary for obtaining offices of honour and profit, it will then be expected that any Quakers who are tempted to renounce their principles, will undoubtedly make an addition to the established church. 
If any other consideration than that which has been mentioned was regarded in granting that indulgence in the Jerseys though no other is expressed, it seems not improbable that the nearness of this Province might have had some weight, as from its situation it afforded such strong temptations to the inhabitants of the Jerseys to remove hither had they been treated with any severity. 
Their government, in some measure, was formed in imitation of our government; but when this is altered, the English constitution must be the model by which it will be formed. Here it will be said, "this cannot be done but by the Parliament; and will a British Parliament do such an act of injustice as to deprive us of our rights?" This is the second argument used to prove the safety of the measures now proposed. 
Certainly the British Parliament will not do what they think an unjust act : but I cannot persuade myself that they will think it unjust to place us on the same footing with themselves. It will not be an easy task to convince them that the people of Pennsylvania ought to be distinguished from all other subjects under his Majesty's immediate government, or that such a distinction can answer any good purpose. May it not be expected that they will say: "No people can be freer than ourselves; everything more than we enjoy is licentiousness, not liberty: any "indulgences shown to the colonies heretofore were like the indulgences of parents to their infants; they ought to cease with that tender age, and, as the colonies grow up to a more vigorous state, they ought to be carefully disciplined, and all their actions regulated by strict laws. Above all things, it is necessary that the prerogative should be exercised with its full force in our American provinces, to restrain them within due bounds and secure their dependance on this kingdom."
I am afraid that this will be the opinion of the Parliament, as it has been, in every instance, the undeviating practice of the ministry. 
But, Sir, it may be said "these reasons are not conclusive, they do not demonstratively prove that our privileges will be endangered by a change." I grant the objection: but what stronger reasons, what clearer proofs are there that they will not be endangered by a change. 
They are safe now ; and why should we engage in an enterprise that will render them uncertain? If nothing will content us but a revolution brought about by ourselves, surely we ought to have made the strictest enquiries what terms we may expect, and to have obtained from the ministry some kind of security for the performance of those terms. 
These things might have been done. They are not done. If a merchant will venture to travel with great riches into a foreign country, without a proper guide, it certainly will be adviseable for him to procure the best intelligence he can get of the climate, the roads, the difficulties he will meet with, and the treatment he may receive. 
I pray the House to consider, if we have the slightest security that can be mentioned, except opinion (if that is any) either for the preservation of our present privileges, or gaining a single advantage from a change. Have we any writing? have we a verbal promise from any Minister of the Crown? We have not. I cannot, therefore, conceal my astonishment, that gentlemen should require a less security for the invaluable rights of Pennsylvania than they would demand for a debt of five pounds. Why should we press forward with this unexampled hurry when no benefit can be derived from it? Why should we have any aversion to deliberation and delay when no injury can attend them? 
It is scarcely possible, in the present case, that we can spend too much time in forming resolutions, the consequences of which are to be perpetual. If it is true, as some aver, that we can now obtain an advantageous change of government, I suppose that it will be also true next week, next month, and next year; but if they are mistaken it will be early enough whenever it happens to be disappointed and to repent. I am not willing to run risques in a matter of such prodigious importance on the credit of any man's opinion^ when by a small delay, that can do no harm, the steps we are to take may become more safe. Gideon though he had conversed with an "angel of the Lord," would not attempt to relieve his countrymen, then sorely opprest by the Midianites least he should involve them in greater miseries, until he was convinced by two miracles that he should be successful. I do not say we ought to wait for miracles^ but I think we ought to wait for something which will be next kin to a miracle; I mean, some sign of a favourable disposition in the ministry towards us. I should like to see an olive leaf least brought 
to us, before we quit the ark. 
Permit me. Sir, to make one proposal to the House. We may apply the Crown now, as freely as if we were under its immediate government. Let us desire his Majesty's judgment on the point * that has occasioned this unhappy difference between the two branches of the legislature. This may be done without anyf violence, without any hazard of our constitution. We say the justice of our demands is clear as light; every heart must feel the equity of them. 
If the decision be in our favour, we gain a considerable victory; the grand obstruction of the public service is removed, and we shall have more leisure to carry our intentions coolly into execution. If the decision be against us, I believe the most zealous amongst us will grant it would be madness to expect success in any other contest. This will be a single point, and cannot meet with such difficulties as the procuring a total alteration of the government. Therefore, by separating it from other matters we shall soon obtain a determination, and know what chance we have of succeeding in things of greater value. Let us try our fortune. Let us take a cast or two of the dice for smaller matters before we dip deeply. Few gamesters are of so sanguine a temper as to stake their whole wealth on one desperate throw at first. If we are to play with the public happiness^ let us act at least with as much deliberation as if we were betting out of our private purses. 
Perhaps a little delay may afford us the pleasure of finding our constituents more unanimous in their opinions on this interesting occasion: and I should chuse to see a vast majority of them join with a calm resolution in the measure before I should think myself justifiable in voting for it, even if I approved of it. 
The present question is utterly foreign from the purposes for which we were sent into this place. There was not the least probability at the time we were elected that this matter could come under our consideration. We are not debating how much money we shall raise, what laws we shall pass for the regulation of property, nor on anything of the same kind that arises in the usual parliamentary course of business. We are now to determine whether 
A STEP SHALL BE TAKEN THAT MAY PRODUCE AN ENTIRE CHANGE OF OUR CONSTITUTION. 
In forming this determination one striking reflection should be preserved in our minds; I mean, "that we are the servants of the people of Pennsylvania of that people who have been induced by the excellence of the present constitution, to settle themselves under its Protection. 
The inhabitants of remote countries, impelled by that love of liberty which allwise Providence has planted in the human heart, deserting their native soils, committed themselves with their helpless families to the mercy of winds and waves, and braved all the terrors of an unknown wilderness in hopes of enjoying in these woods the exercise of those invaluable rights which some unhappy circumstance had denied to mankind in every other part of the earth. 
Thus, Sir, the people of Pennsylvania may be said to have purchased in inheritance in its constitution, at a prodigious price; and I cannot believe, unless the strongest evidence be offered, that they are now willing to part with that which has cost them so much toil and expence. 
They have not hitherto been disappointed in their wishes. They have obtained the blessings they sought for. 
We have received these seats by the free choice of this people under this constitution; and to preserve it in its utmost purity and vigour, has always been deem'd by me a principal part of the trust committed to my care and fidelity. The measure now proposed has a direct tendency to endanger this constitution, and, therefore, in my opinion, we have no right to engage in it without the almost universal consent of the people exprest in the plainest manner. 
I think I should improperly employ the attention of this House if I should take up much time in proving that the deputies of a people have not a right, by any law divine or human, to change the government under which their authority was delegated to them, without such a consent as has been mentioned. � The position is so consonant to natural justice and common sense, that I believe it never has been seriously controverted. All the learned authors that I recollect to have mentioned this matter speak of it as an indisputable maxim. 
It may be said, perhaps, in answer to this objection, "that it is not intended to change the government, but the governor." This, I apprehend, is a distinction only in words. The government is certainly to be changed from proprietary to royal, and whatever may be intended the question is, whether such a change will not expose our present privileges to danger. 
It may also be said "that the petitions lying on the table are a proof of the people's consent." Can petitions so industriously carried about, and after all the pains taken, signed only by about thirty-five hundred persons, be look'd on as the plainest expression of the almost universal consent of the many thousands that fill this Province? No one can believe it.
It cannot be denied. Sir, that much the greatest part of the inhabitants of this Province, and among them men of large fortunes, good sense, and fair characters, who value very highly the interest they have in the present constitution, have not signed these petitions, and, as there is reason to apprehend, are extremely averse to a change at this time. Will they not complain of such a change? 
And if it is not attended with all the advantages they now enjoy, will they not have reason to complain? It is not improbable that this measure may lay the foundation of more bitter and more lasting dissentions among us than 
any we have yet experienced. 
Before I close this catalogue of unhappy consequences, that I expect will follow our request of a change, I beg leave to take notice of the terms of the petition that is now under the consideration of the House. 
They equally excite in my breast � surprise, and grief, and terror. This poor Province is already sinking under the weight of the discredit and reproaches that, by some fatality^ for several years past have attended our public measures; and we not only seize this unfortunate season to engage her in new difficulties, but prepare to pour on her devoted head a load that must effectually crush her. We inform the King by this petition that Pennsylvania is become a scene of confusion and anarchy: that armed mobs are marching from one place to another: that such a spirit of violence and riot prevails as exposes his Majesty's good subjects to constant alarms and danger: and that this tumultuous disposition is so general that it cannot be controuled by any powers of the present government; and that we have not any hopes of returning to a state of peace and safety but by being taken under his Majesty's immediate protection.
I cannot think this a proper representation of the present state of this Province. Near four months are elapsed since the last riot, and I do not perceive the least probability of our being troubled with any more. The rioters were not only successfully opposed, and prevented from executing their purpose, but, we have reason to believe, that they were convinced of their error, and have renounced all thoughts of such wild attempts for the future. To whose throat is the sword now held? What life will be saved by this application? Imaginary danger! Vain remedy! Have we not sufficiently felt the effects of royal resentment? Is not the authority of the Crown fully enough exerted over us? Does it become us to paint, in the strongest colours, the folly or the crimes of our countrymen? To require unnecessary protection against men who intend us no injury, in such loose or general expressions as may produce even the establishment of an armed force among use 
With unremitting vigilance, with undaunted virtue, should a free people watch against the encroachments of power, and remove every pretext for its extension. 
We are a dependant colony; and we need not doubt that means will be used to secure that dependance. But that we ourselves should furnish a reason for settling a military establishment upon us, must exceed the most extravagant wishes of those who would be most pleased with such a measure. 
We may introduce the innovation, but we shall not be able to stop its progress. The precedent will be pernicious. If a specious pretence is afforded for maintaining a small body of troops among us now, equally specious pretences will never be wanting hereafter for adding to their numbers. The burthen that will be imposed on us for their support is the most trifling [29] part of the evil. The poison will soon reach our vitals. Whatever struggles we may make to expell it, 
The dart with which we are struck will still remain fixed � too firmly fixed, for our feeble hands to draw it out. Our fruitless efforts will but irritate the wound, and at length we must tamely submit to � I quit a subject too painful to be dwelt upon. 
These, Sir, are my sentiments on the petition that has occasioned this debate. I think this neither the proper season nor the proper method for obtaining a change of our government. It is uncertain whether the measures proposed will place us in a better situation than we are now in, with regard to the point lately controverted; with respect to other particulars, it may place us in a worse. We shall run the risque of suffering great losses. We have certainty of gaining anything. In seeking a precarious hasty violent remedy for the present partial disorder, we are sure of exposing the whole body to danger. I cannot perceive the necessity of applying such a remedy. If I did, I would with the greatest pleasure pass over to the opinion of some gentlemen who differ from me, whose integrity and abilities I so much esteem, that whatever reasons at any time influence me to agree with them, I always receive a satisfaction from being on their side. If I have erred now, I shall comfort myself with reflecting that it is an innocent err-or. Should the measures pursued in consequence of this debate be opposite to my opinion, and should they procure a change of government with all the benefits we desire, I shall not envy the praise of others, who by their fortunate courage and skill have conducted us unhurt, through the midst of such threatening dangers, to the wished for port. I shall cheerfully submit to the censure of having been too apprehensive of injuring the people of this Province. If any severer sentence shall be passed upon me by the worthy, I shall be sorry for it; but this truth I am convinced of, that it will be much easier for me to bear the unmerited reflections of mistaken zeal than the just reproaches of a guilty mind. To have concealed my real sentiments, or to have counterfeited such as I do not entertain, in a deliberation of so much consequence as the present, would have been the basest hypocrisy. It may, perhaps, be thought that this, however, would have been the most politic part for me to have acted. It might have been so. But if policy requires, that our words or actions should belye our hearts, I thank God that I detest and despise all its arts and all its advantages. A good man ought to serve his country, even though she resents his services. The great reward of honest actions is not the fame or profit that follows them, but the consciousness that attends them. To discharge on this important occasion the inviolable duty I owe the public, by obeying the unbiassed dictates of my reason and conscience^ hath been my sole view; and my only wish now is that the resolutions of this House, whatever they are, may promote the happiness of Pennsylvania, 
FINIS.
