THE annals of prosecutions do not present to the world a more extraordinary case than that of the unfortunate man who is the subject of the following pages. It is not, however, for us, in the present stage of this business, to declaim either against the laws of the British empire, or the persons to whom those laws are entrusted. An innocent man has nothing to fear from the scourge of truth�'tis the guilty only that need tremble at investigation. The notorious character, of whatever species, pleasingly exults in the obscurity of his depraved actions�but when the keen eye of discovery penetrates his horrid mansion, he would chearfully give a thousand worlds to escape enquiry: It may be well for individuals, both of high and low degree, to mark these observations. 
Not to detain the reader with a long introduction, we shall take the liberty of prefacing this narrative with a fictitious one, where the scenes might have occurred in another country, and leave Englishmen to make what comments they please. Suppose then the following occurrences in Sweden or any other country, under whatever governments your own minds may conceive.
It is presumed the laws of every government is very explicit, particularly with respect to transgressions and punishments; this has been the boast of Britons, and we shall think but little of France, till she has, by intrinsic merit, acquired that degree of eminence. In Sweden, however, we suppose that a certain publication of exclamation and declamation were sent into the world (such as Mr. Burke's for instance) violently condemning the principles of the British Revolution in 1688, and consigning the abettors of that Revolution to destruction; that another person, of opposite political principles, were hardy enough to attack the bold declaimer; and while justifying such a Revolution, was to make some very severe and pointed strictures on the government of Sweden. Suppose then the legislature of Sweden finding the last writer had exposed some of their malpactices, and were to be fearful the contagion would spread, whereby they might be deprived of their noble feasting, &c. &c.�in consequence of which they determined to institute an action against their bold competitor, in order to try the merits of the work, and, if possible, to condemn it by due course of law;�suppose they were to take advantage, by proclamations, &c. and prosecute poor individuals who might be found selling the intended proscribed work, before it was actually proscribed by a fair and regular trial�would not the indignation of every English spectator be raised at the littleness, the meanness, the wretchedness, of the Swedish legislators, who dared to violate the rights of man in so flagrant a manner? Oh Albion, how great are thy superior privileges!
Immediately on the institution of a celebrated Society at the Crown and Anchor, for preserving places and pensions, Mr. Spence, being a poor man, and less likely to oppose the lordly menaces of violent Aristocracy, was repeatedly surrounded, insulted, and even threatened with his life, and the destruction of his little all, if he did not give up part of his bread, and decline selling the Rights of Man, and other political tracts. The eagerness of the public mind for political investigation, almost rendered it useless for him to keep any other articles: and therefore, to a poor man, it was indeed a very [...] us sacrifice, unless they had threatened him likewise with an ample [..?] compensation. Indeed their conduct was contemptible, for no one of the opposite party ever offered him the most modest reproach for selling even Mr. Burke's pamphlets! It may be observed, that Mr. Spence, being so exposed, with only a stall in the open street, these petty beings, thought they might presume on his unprotected situation. Even a pious Rector had the audacity to attack the defenceless man, and endeavoured to avail himself of the natural influence of his profession over the landlord, by urging him to turn Mr. Spence out of the stall. Oh, Depravity, where is thy blush!
On Thursday morning, Dec. 6, 1792, two runners, at the instance of a Mr. Reeves *, came to T. Spence's stall, and bought, by mistake, Spence's Rights of Man, instead of Paine's Rights of Man. Immediately on which they took him, with their usual ceremony, before the civil magistrate at the police office in Hatton Garden, and laid their information against him. To the honour of the magistrate, however, he declined committing Mr. Spence, as he could find no statute to justify him in it. Mr. Spence told him in his defence, that he might as well commit every one who sold Gulliver's Travels, More's Eutropi [...], Lock on Government, Puffendorf on the Law of Nature, &c. &c. all of which treated the subject of Government in a manner vastly opposite to the British system. Here, however, we must observe, that no compensation was made to Mr. Spence for tearing him, like a criminal, from his business, &c. &c.
Monday, the 10th of December, between two and three o'clock, two of the Bow-street runners came to Mr. Spence, and purchased Paine's Rights of Man; after which in the most unprecedented manner, without even shewing the least authority, they obliged him to put up the shutters of his stall, and hustled him into an hackney-coach, which they ordered to be driven to Bow-street. During the bustle and the journey, Mr. Spence, feeling, very properly, the indignity offered both to law and justice by these proceedings, remonstrated with the prostituted ruffians, and modestly asked them whether he was to consider himself in Spain, Turkey, Algiers, or England? It appeared to him as though he were enchanted to one of the most despotic spots in the universe. Never perhaps were the rights of citizens so shamefully invaded as in this instance; nor shall we wonder if the complaints of individuals in this respect should drive them to acts of desperation�may the great God however avert such a catastrophe!
When the unfortunate prisoner arrived at Bow-street, the magistrate was at dinner; of course the victim of despotism was carried to a public house near the office, where he was safely guarded, at least three hours, till his worship had finished his repast. In this blessed mansion the runners, by what authority can hardly be guessed, (unless their honourable profession warranted it,) searched Mr. Spence's pockets, and even took from him his pocket book, papers and memorandums relating to his business, &c. which they have never yet returned. The pocketbook contained extracts from Locke, Puffendorf, Swift, Pope, and even the 25th chapter of the book of Leviticus, all of which related to government, and may, according to the present system of proceedings, be equally termed libellous. Perhaps since the days of bloody Queen Mary have no prisoner, under the same circumstances, been treated in so violent a manner as Mr. Spence was during his stay in the public house. Will it be credited that a man, assuming the air of a gentleman, could wantonly insult even the most guilty felon; and yet it is a fact, that a person of such a description seized Mr. Spence by the throat, and had not fear prevented, would willingly have strangled him�uttering the most horrid imprecations that he was not warranted in carrying his inveterate malice to such an extreme. Well, indeed' might Mr. Spence exclaim, What country am I in! Nature shudders at the relation of instances of such depravity in the human race; and those despicable characters scarcely deserve the epithet of human, much less the animating title of Britons! It surely will hardly be credited hereafter that these are the actions of the eighteenth century! Better for Englishmen openly to request a Bastile� they would then at least be on their guard. In the present instance they have been grossly misled into the violation of laws which they have understood were never promulgated, and are treated as traitors for crimes they never dreamt of. The book had not been condemned by a legal process, and they had always been taught that no crime attached itself to selling any publication till it was thus legally proscribed. Is not this the language of almost every person both in the House of Commons and out of it?
It is folly�it is madness for men in these days idly to chatter about their darling hobby horse�Liberty. A great part of them in the midst of such childish exclamations are positively endeavouring to outrun each other; and by nick-named loyalty eagerly striving which shall sacrifice his dearest interest, and the interest of his posterity to the most inflexible despotism that ever disgraced the world. (These observations cannot apply to Englishmen.)
We must now direct the reader's attention to the transactions in the Public Office. After the usual technical formula Mr. Spence requested his worship to inform him by what authority his journeymen were justified in their proceedings? With all the sagacity which the nature of the case inspired, his worship adverted to the Royal Proclamations, and even to the opinion of the Grand Jury. Mr. Spence was naturally led to doubt either the validity of indifinite Proclamations, or the legality of the opinion of the Grand Jury, in justification of arbitrary proceedings, previous to a public trial. However, agreeable to the natural order of things, the prisoner being the weakest party, was obliged to submit.�To the honor, or rather to the disgrace, of the mercenary attendants of Public Offices, Mr. Spence was assailed by a considerable party with threats and violent pushes, that even the American Indians would have thought a disgrace to their savage manners. With all the deliberation and coolness so characteristic of a blood-thirsty crew, the instruments of this extraordinary business delivered an exaggerated evidence, fearing perhaps, they should be deprived of their emoluments by the prisoner's escape. When will man reflect and consider the true dignity of the human species, by acting conformable to his judgment, and despising every thing that may impeach his integrity! This will apply from the highest character in states through every gradation, civil and official, down to the common hangman. With a very ill grace then does it become the implements of abuses to strain every nerve both of violence and injustice, for securing to themselves the wretched enjoyment of places, which in their own consciences they hold contemptible.
The runners (will it be credited?) had the consummate impudence to threaten this unfortunate man with leading him through the streets heavy ironed, if he would not submit to pay the hire of a coach to Clerkenwell Prison; nay, they had the audacity to bring forth irons for the purpose. Mr. Spence, however, with that dignity, which conscious innocence naturally inspires, spurned the monsters and their threats, and told them he would rather submit to be led like a felon, than suffer such an imposition. At length they consented to conduct him to goal without those unnecessary implements, where he arrived about eleven o'clock at night. Here Mr. Spence was ushered in with the usual salutations of the collegia [...]c officers, which consisted of the most abusive menaces and illiberal treatment that their ingenuity could possibly invent. He was asked whether he chose to have a bed; and upon answering in the affirmative, an immediate demand of one shilling was made by one of the turnkeys for that indulgence�he had likewise one penny to pay for the use of a candle, which the turnkey held in his hand; nor did the wretch allow him time to take off his cloaths before he locked him up in a solitary cell.�The bed was so immoderately damp as to oblige him to lay down in his cloaths, and in the morning he found himself so poorly as led him to fear the consequences.
In the morning Mr. Spence was taken from his forlorn dungeon, and sent down into the yard among the most common felons, where he was accosted by the miserable collegians in their usual stile.
The poor wretches always rejoice to see strangers introduced, as it is customary for them to apply to every New Prisoner for garnish, either that they may allay the cravings of hunger, or drown the recollection of their unhappy situations in liquor. To add to his misfortunes, Mr. Spence was obliged to comply with all their demands, or be denied the privilege of citizenship even among them; and it cost him in goal fees, garnish, &c. in the course of thirty hours, previous to being liberated by bail, one pound four shillings, which to a poor man is a great sum.
During the absence of Mr. Spence from his stall, some mischievous person or persons (perhaps delegated from the usual source) had the impudence to write three separate papers and stick them on his shutters, purporting, "That the owner was confined in gaol for selling seditious books; and they hoped it would be a warning to others."
The Public need only be informed that the Grand-Jury, afterwards found a true Bill of Indictment against Mr. Spence, and it remains for him now to await a judicial decision.
To enumerate the numerous persecutions which Mr. Spence has endured previous to the foregoing Process; and since, would take more time than the Editor could well spare.
One instance, however, it would be almost unpardonable to pass over unnoticed. On Thursday the 13th of December, the day his Majesty opened the present session of parliament, a gentleman, or one who aimed to be thought so, came to Mr. Spence's stall, and, seeing a young man with the first part of Paine's Rights of Man in his hand (which by the bye has never been even disputed by the Attorney-General), seized the book, and in a curious (alias Grub-street) dialect, abused Mr. Spence, hustled him about, tore his shirt, and dragged him to an adjoining shop, where, joined by more of his brutal fraternity, he robbed the poor man of two other books. One of the villains hastened to the Police Office to fetch some runners, while the others guarded the persecuted man, uttering violent threats, savage menaces, &c. &c. The spectators, however, to their honour be it mentioned, observing the lengths the ruffians would carry their infamous conduct, calmly interfered and rescued the prisoner from the hands of the most diabolical and lawless banditti that ever threatened the peace of the metropolis. Perhaps these were some of the immaculate members of a certain inquisitorial Society; at least they must be sanctioned by a dark and mysterious group, not less diabolical than themselves.
1. REFLECTIONS.
The present aerea seems as a dream, one can scarcely credit the transactions of every preceding day. Truth is a libel, and falshood is a libel�how then to steer between the two extremes, requires the sagacity of a knave, or the duplicity of a hypocrite. To what a situation is the intellects of man reduced! Were it possible to deprive the numerous hoards of mankind (with very few exceptions) of their rational faculties�to divest them of thinking�to restrain them from speaking�to draw a veil over their occult powers�and cancel their sensibility; it would be perfectly conformable with prevailing politics to attempt the experiment. Infatuation and ignorance�depravity and corruption�violence and intrigue, seem united against the progress of knowledge, and the interest of society. The world, however, has ever been governed by fluctuations, and what one age or one description of beings have estimated as blessings, succeeding ages or a different description of beings have estimated as curses. Perhaps some degree of propriety �has attached itself to each party, and rational minds have only been able to contemplate the consequences, without the power of affording any alleviation to the victims of contention. But may we not anticipate a better age, and a superior degree of civilization; when society will be united under one interest, and man be no more the dupe of faction�when peace will spread her genial wings and leave the human mind to the enjoyment of those blessings which nature has so bountefully bestowed, when industry will be relieved from the almost insurmountable fetters of the present hour, and the only barrier to civil enjoyments will be those of vicious inclinations.
A review of the numerous characters of Europe, who, with minds that would do honour to the higher ranks, but from the largness of their families, and political circumstances are bowed down with poverty and oppression, will fully justify the feeling mind in ardently panting for so glorious an aera.
On Monday the 24th of December, Mr. Spence received the following notice from his landlord by the hands of the landlord's daughter.
