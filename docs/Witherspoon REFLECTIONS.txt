REFLECTIONS
On the present State of PUBLIC AFFAIRS, and on the Duty and Interest of America in this Important Crisis
That the present is an important era to America, and has been so often repeated, but I suppose no man doubts it, and I hope you will forget it. Yet, however august the idea, it is capable of being greatly enlarged. It will be an important era in the history of mankind. The extent of this country is such, that as it is now, and probably will soon be settled, it makes no inconsiderable part of the globe itself. The European in general, particularly the British settlements in America, have for these hundred years past, been exhibiting to the world a scene differing in many respects from what it ever beheld. In all the ancient emigrations, or colonial settlements, the number was small, the territory very limited, and which was still more, the people and the soil were almost alike uncultivated; and therefore both proceeded to improvement by very slow degrees. But in America we see a country almost without bounds, new and untouched, taken possession of that once by the power, the learning, and the wealth of Europe.
Hence it is that the cultivation and the population of America have advanced with a rapidity next to miraculous, and of which no political calculators have principles or data sufficient to make a certain judgment. I hold every thing that has been said on the numbers in America to be good for nothing, except in certain places where they have proceeded on actual numeration. When writers state, that the inhabitants in America doubled themselves in twenty or twenty-five years, they speak by guess, and they say nothing. It may be under or over the truth in certain places; but there are others in which they become twenty times the number in seven years. I do not know, and therefore will not attempt to conjecture, how fast mankind by multiplying a country that is in the most favorable state possible, both in itself, and for receiving an accession from others less happily circumstanced. What is more certain, as well as of more importance to observe, is, that the British colonies in North-America, and have in this respect exceeded every other country upon the face of the earth.
What has caused this difference? Does the climate of Britain naturally produce more wisdom, strength and activity, denied of France, Spain or Portugal? Surely not, or wo to America itself; for the best of its colonies are in the climate of these very countries. It is therefore without doubt owing to the liberty which pervades the British constitution, and came with the colonists to this part of the earth. Montesquieu has, with inimitable beauty, shewn that the natural causes of population or depopulation, are not half so powerful is the moral causes; by which last he means the state of society, the form of government, and the manners of the people. War, famine and pestilence are scarcely felt, where there is liberty and equal laws. The wound made by those sore judgments is speedily closed by the vigor of the Constitution; whereas, in a more sickly frame, a trifling scratch will rankle and produce long disease, or perhaps terminate in death. We need go no further than our own country to have full proof of the force of liberty. The southern colonies, blessed as they are with a superior soil and more powerful sun, are yet greatly inferior to Pennsylvania and New-England, in numbers, strength, and value of land in proportion to its quantity. The matter is easily solved. The constitutions of these latter colonies or more favorable to universal industry.
But with all the differences between one colony in another, America in general, by its gradual improvement, not long ago exhibited a spectacle, the most delightful that can be conceived, to a benevolent and contemplative mind. A country, growing every year in beauty and fertility, the people growing in numbers and wealth, arts and sciences carefully cultivated and constantly advancing and possessing security of property by liberty and equal laws, which are the true and proper source of all the rest. While things were in this situation, Great Britain reaped a great, unenvied, and still increasing profit from the trade of the colonies. I am neither so weak as to believe, nor so foolish as to affirm, as some did in the beginning of this contest, that the colony trade was the whole support of the majority of the people in Great Britain. How could any person of reflection suppose that the foreign trade of 3 millions of people, could be the chief support of eight millions, when the internal trade of these 8 millions themselves, is and must be the support of double the number that could be supported by the trade of America, besides their trade to every other part of the world? But our trade was still of great importance and value, and yielded to Great Britain yearly, a prophet vastly superior�s to any thing they could reasonably hope to draw from taxes and impositions, although they had been submitted to without complaint.
This however did not satisfy the king, ministry and parliament of Great Britain. They formed Golden, but mistaken and delusive hopes of lightening their own burdens by levying taxes from us. They formed various plans, and attempted various measures, not the most prudent I confess, for carrying their purpose into effect. Ultimate purpose itself was in some degree covered at first, and they hope to bring it about by slow and imperceptible steps. In some instances the imposition was in itself of little consequence; as appointing the colonies to furnish salt, pepper and vinegar to the troops. But the laudable and jealous spirit of liberty was alive and awake, and hardly suffered any of them to pass unobserved or unresisted. Public spirited writers took care that it should not sleep; and in particular the celebrated Pennsylvania Farmer�s Letters were of signal service, by furnishing the lovers of their country with facts, and illustrating the rights and privileges which it was their duty to defend.
The last attempt made by the ministry in the way of art and address, was repealing the act laying duties on paper, glass, and painter�s colors, and leaving a small duty on tea, attended with such circumstances, that the tea should come to us no dear, or perhaps cheaper, than before. This was evidently with design that we might be induced to let it pass, and so the claim having once taken place, might be carried in other instances to the greatest height. This maneuver, however, did not elude the vigilance of a public spirited people. The whole colonies declared their resolution never to receive it.


Ignorance of the British with respect to America.
To the Editor of the Scots Magazine.
Philadelphia, May 28, 1771.
Sir,
I saw on your magazine (Appendix 1770) a letter, signed E. R. Containing some remarks upon, and a severe condemnation of Dr.Lathrop�s sermon at Boston, entitled, �Innocent Blood crying for Vengeance.� These remarks are introduced with observing, that the synod of New-York and Philadelphia had written a letter, and claimed relation to the Church of Scotland; and then says the author, �I�m reading of which, I could not help thinking, if we may judge of the American church from the sample here given, that our church derives no great honor from her western progeny; but I hope the flock is better than the sample.�
Now, sir, as to this author�s observations on Dr.Lathrop�s sermon, I shall say little; because perhaps it cannot be wholly justified � yet, if all circumstances are truly attended to, there is as little reason to insult or glory over the people of Boston, as there was to excite the public resentment against Capt. P �. But what I have only in view, is shortly to expose the excessive absurdity and ignorance of bringing in this synod of New-York and Philadelphia on this occasion. Where the author of the sermon even a member of the synod, or any way connected with it, the attempt would be in pertinent; because no church can be supposed answerable for the prudence of every particular person connected with her, especially the wisdom or propriety of their publications. Does the church of Scotland desire to be judged by this rule? I suppose not. Nor will I be guilty of so much injustice, is to judge of her by this her friend and advocate. �I hope (as he says) the stock is better than the sample.� For,
How astonishing must be the ignorance of that gentleman concerning the British dominions in America, when he supposes the ministers of Boston to be part of the synod of New-York and Philadelphia! Did the synod�s letter say any such thing? Did you not enumerate provinces in which their members reside? Did not inform the public, that it is but seventy years since the first presbytery met in this country? But give me leave to inform your correspondent, that it is about one hundred and forty years since the people of New-England established a college at Cambridge near Boston; that their churches are upon the independent plan, and are in four New-England provinces about five hundred in number whereas the whole synod of New-York and Philadelphia contained, when their letter was written, but one hundred and twenty-seven members, and does not now amount to one hundred and fifty.
I did not mean by this to disclaim connexion with the churches of New-England. They are a most respectable part of the church of Christ. Nor do I think that any part of the British Empire is at this day, equal to them for real religion and sound morals. My single purposes to teacher correspondence, and your readers in general, not to write upon American affairs, unless they understand them. I tell you nothing but truth when I say, that being a Briton, I have often blushed in company, to hear stories narrated of the absurd and ignorant manner in which persons of no inconsiderable stations in Britain, have talked of things and places in America. We have heard of a gentleman in the house of commons, frequently making mention of the island of Pennsylvania; and of another who was the privy Council insisted, after contradiction, on his being right in his description of the island of New-Jersey.
But what excels every saying is the following story, which I have been assured by persons well acquainted with it, was the fact. Some years ago, a frigate came from England with dispatches for many, or most of the governors of the provinces in North America. The Captain Had Orders to Go First to New-York, and from thence to proceed to Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and the Jerseys. When he arrived at New-York, he delivered his dispatches there, and mentioned his orders. The governor told him, if you will give me the letters for the governors of New-Jersey and Pennsylvania, I will undertake to have them delivered in forty-eight hours; but if you take the route prescribed to you, perhaps they will not receive them in three months. To which the captain replied, I do not care a farthing about the matter; I will stick to my instructions.
I am, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,
X.Y.
