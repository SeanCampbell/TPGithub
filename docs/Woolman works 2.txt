   MY esteemed friend, Abraham Farrington, being about to make a visit to
friends on the eastern side of this province, and having no companion, he proposed to me to go with him; and, after a conference with some elderly friends, I agreed to go; we set out the fifth day of the ninth month, in the year 1743; had an evening-meeting at a tavern in Brunswick, a town in which none
of our society dwelt; the room was full, and the people quiet. Thence to Amboy, and had an evening-meeting in the court-house; to which many people came, amongst whom were several members of the assembly, they
being in town on public affairs of the province: in both these meetings my ancient companion was enlarged to preach, in the love of the gospel. Thence we Went to Woodbridge, Raway, and Plainfield; and had six or seven meetings in places where meetings of friends are not usually held, being made up chiefly of presbyterians; and my beloved companion was frequently strengthened to
publish the word of life amongst them: as for me, I was often silent; and, when I spake, it was with much care, that I might speak only what truth opened: and I learned some profitable lessons. � We were out about two weeks.
   Near this time, being on some outward business in which several families were concerned, and which was attended with difficulties, some things relating thereto not being clearly stated, nor rightly understood by all, there
arose some heat in the minds of the parties and one valuable friend got off his watch; I had a great regard for him, and felt a strong inclination, after matters were settled, to speak to him concerning his conduct in that case: but I being a youth, and he far advanced in age and experience, my way appeared difficult; but, after some days deliberation, and inward seeking to the Lord for assistance, I was made subject; so that I expressed what lay upon me in a way which became my youth and his years: and, though it was a hard task to me, it was well taken, and, I believe, was useful to us both.
   Having now been several years with my employer, and he doing less at merchandize than heretofore, I was thoughtful of some other way of business; perceiving merchandize to be attended with much cumber, in the way of trading in these parts.
   My mind, through the power of truth, was in a good degree weaned from the desire of outward greatness, and I was learning to be content with real conveniences, that were not costly; so that a way of life, free from much entanglement, appeared belt for-me, though the income might be small. I had several offers of business that appeared profitable, but did not see my way clear to accept of them; as believing the business proposed would be attended with more outward care than was required of me to engage in.
   I saw that a humble man, with the blessing of the Lord, might live on a little: and that where the heart was set on greatness, success in business did not satisfy the craving; but that commonly, wish an increase of  wealth, the desire of wealth increases. There was a care on my mind so to pass my time, that
nothing might hinder me from the most steady attention to the voice of the true Shepherd.
   My employer, though now a retailer of goods, was by trade a taylor, and kept a servant-man at that business; and I began to think about learning the trade, expecting that, if I should settle, I might, by this trade and a little retailing of goods, get a living in a plain way, without the load of great business: I mentioned it to my employer, and we soon agreed on terms; and then, when I had leisure from the affairs of merchandize, I worked with his man. I believed
the hand of Providence pointed out this business for me; and was taught to be content with it, though I felt, at times, a disposition that would have sought for something greater: but, through the revelation of Jesus Christ, I had seen the happiness of humility, and there was an earnest desire in me to enter deep into it; and, at times, this desire arose to a degree of fervent supplication,
wherein my soul was so environed with heavenly light and consolation, that things were made easy to me which had been otherwise.
   After some time, my employer's wife died; she was a virtuous woman, and generally beloved of her neighbours: and soon after this, he left shopkeeping, and we parted. I then wrought at my trade, as a taylor; carefully attended meetings for worship and discipline; and found an enlargement of gospel-love in my mind, and therein a concern to visit friends in some of the back-settlements of Pennsylvania and Virginia; and, being thoughtful about a companion, I expressed it to my beloved friend, Isaac Andrews, who then told
me that he had drawings to the same places; also to go through Maryland, Virginia, and Carolina. After considerable time past, and several conferences with him, I felt easy to accompany him throughout, if way opened for it. I opened the case in our monthly meeting; and, friends expressing their unity
therewith, we obtained certificates to travel as companions; his from Haddonfield, and mine from Burlington. 
   We left our province on the twelfth day of the third month, in the year 1746, and had several meetings in the upper part of Chester county, and near Lancaster; in some of which, the love of Christ prevailed, uniting us together in his service. Then we crossed the river Susquehannah, and had several meetings in a new settlement, called the Red-Lands; the oldest of which, as I
was informed, did not exceed ten years. It is the poorer fort of people that commonly begin to improve remote desarts: with a small stock they have houses to build, lands to clear and fence, corn to raise, clothes to provide, and children to educate; that friends, who visit such, may well sympathise with
them in their hardships in the wilderness; and though the best entertainment such can give may seem coarse to some who are used to cities, or old settled places, it becomes the disciples of Christ to be content with it. Our hearts were sometimes enlarged in the love of our heavenly Father amongst these people;
and the sweet influence of his spirit supported us through some difficulties: to him be the praise!
   We passed on to Manoquacy, Fairfax, Hopewell, and Shanando, and had meetings; some of which were comfortable and edifying. From Shanando we set off in the afternoon for the old settlements of friends in Virginia; and, the first night, we, with our pilot, lodged in the woods, our horses feeding near us; but he, being poorly provided with a horse, and we young and having good
horses, were free the next day to part with him; and did so. In two days after, we reached to our friend John Cheagle's, in Virginia: so we took the meetings in our way through Virginia; were, in some degree, baptized into a feeling sense of the conditions of the people; and our exercise in general was more painful in these old settlements, than it had been amongst the back inhabitants: but, through the goodness of our heavenly Father, the well of living-waters was, at times, opened to our encouragement and the refreshment of the sincere-hearted. We went on to Perquimons, in North-Carolina; had several meetings, which were large; and found some openness in 
those parts, and a hopeful appearance amongst the young people. So we turned again to Virginia, and attended; most of the meetings which we had not been at before, laboring amongst friends in the love of Jesus Christ, as ability was given: and thence went to the mountains, up James-River, to a new settlement; and had several meetings amongst the people, some of whom had lately joined in membership with our society.
   In our journeying to and fro, we found some honest-hearted friends, who appeared to be concerned for the cause of truth, among a backsliding people.
   From Virginia, we crossed over the river Patowmac, at Hoe's ferry, and made a general visit to the meetings of friends on the western shore of Maryland� and were at their quarterly meeting. We had some hard labour amongst them, endeavouring to discharge our duty honestly as way opened, in the love of truth: and thence taking sundry meetings in our way, we passed homeward;
where, through the favour of divine Providence, we reached the sixteenth day of the sixth month, in the year 1746; and I may say that, through the assistance of the Holy Spirit, my companion and I travelled in harmony, and parted in the nearness of true brotherly love.
   Two things were remarkable to me in this journey: first, in regard to my entertainment; when I ate, drank, and lodged free-cost with people, who lived in ease on the hard labour of their slaves, I felt uneasy; and, as my mind was inward to the Lord, I found, from place to place, this uneasiness return upon me, at times, through the whole visit. Where the masters bore a good share of the burthen, and lived frugally, so that their servants were well provided for, and their labour moderate, I felt more easy; but where they lived in a costly way, and laid heavy burthens on their slaves, my exercise was often great, and I frequently had conversation with them, in private, concerning it; secondly: this trade of importing slaves from their native country being much encouraged amongst them, and the white people and their children so generally living without much labour, was frequently the subject of my serious thoughts: and I saw in these southern provinces so many vices and corruptions, increased by this trade and this way of life, that it appeared to me as a gloom over the land; and though now many willingly run into it, yet, in future, the consequence will be grievous to posterity: I express it as it hath appeared to me, not at once, nor twice, but as a matter fixed on my mind.
   Soon after my return home, I felt an increasing concern for friends on our sea-coast; and, on the eighth day of the eighth month, in the year 1746, with the unity of friends, and in company with my beloved friend and neighbour, Peter Andrews, brother to my companion before-mentioned, we set forward, and visited meetings generally about Salem, Cape May, Great and Little Egg-
Harbour; and had meetings at Barnagat, Mannahockin, and Mane-Squan, and so to the yearly meeting at Shrewsbury. Through the goodness of the Lord way was opened, and she strength of divine love was sometimes felt in our assemblies, to the comfort and help of those who were rightly concerned before him. We were out twenty-two days, and rode, by computation, three hundred and forty miles. At Shrewsbury yearly meeting, we met with our dear friends, Michael Lightfoot and Abraham Farrington, who had good service there.
   The winter following my eldest sister, Elizabeth Woolman, jun. died of the small-pox, aged thirty-one year. She was, from her youth, of a thoughtful disposition; and very compassionate to her acquaintance in their sickness or distress; being ready to help as far as she could; She was dutiful to her
parents; one instance whereof follows: � It happened that she, and two of her sisters, being then near the estate of young women, had an inclination, one first-day after meeting, to go on a visit to some other young women at some distance off; whose company, I believe, would have done them no good. They expressed their desire to our parents; who were dissatisfied with the proposal, and stopped them. The same day, as my sisters and I were together, and they
talking about their disappointment, Elizabeth expressed her contentment under it; signifying, she believed it might be for their good.
   A few years after she attained to mature-age, through the gracious visitations of God's love, she was strengthened to live a self-denying exemplary life, giving herself much to reading and meditation.
   The following letter may shew, in some degree, her disposition.
    Of late I found drawings in my mind to visit friends in New-England, and, having an opportunity of joining in company with my beloved friend, Peter Andrews, we, having obtained certificates from our monthly meeting, set forward on the sixteenth day of the third month, in the year 1747, and
reached the yearly meeting at Long-lsland; at which were our friends, Samuel Nottingham from England, John Griffith, Jane Hoskins, and Elizabeth Hudson from Pennsylvania, and Jacob Andrews from Chesterfield. Several of whom were favoured in their public exercise; and, through the goodness of the Lord, we had some edifying meetings. After this, my companion and I visited friends on Long-island; and, through the mercies of God, we were helped in the work. 
   Besides going to the settled meetings of friends, we were at a general meeting at Setawket, chiefly made up of other societies: and had a meeting at Oyster-Bay in a dwelling-house, at which were many people: at the first of which there was not much said by way of testimony; but it was, I believe, a
good meeting: at the latter, through the springing up of living-waters, it was a day to be thankfully remembered. Having visited the island, we went over to the main, taking meetings in our way, to Oblong, Nine-Partners, and New-Milford. � In these back-settlements we met with several people, who,
through the immediate workings of the spirit of Christ on their minds, were drawn from the vanities of the world, to an inward acquaintance with him: they were educated in the way of the presbyterians. A considerable number of the youth, members of that society, used to spend their time often together
in merriment; but some of the principal young men of that company being visited by the powerful workings of the spirit of Christ, and thereby led humbly to take up his cross, could no longer join in those vanities; and,
as these stood stedfast to that inward convincement, they were made a blessing to some of their former companions; so that, through the power of truth, several were brought into a close exercise concerning the eternal well-
being of their souls. These young people continued for a time to frequent their public worship; and, besides that, had meetings of their own; which meetings were a while allowed by their preacher, who, sometimes, met with them: but, in time, their judgement, in matters of religion, disagreeing with some of the articles of the presbyterians, their meetings were disapproved by that society; and such of them as stood firm to their duty, as it was inwardly manifested,
had many difficulties to go through: and their meetings were in a while dropped; some of them returning to the Presbyterians; and others of them, after a time, joined our religious society. 
   I had conversation with some of the latter, to my help and edification, and believe several of them are acquainted with the nature of that worship, which is performed in spirit and in truth. From hence, accompanied by Amos Powel, a friend From Long-Island, we rode through Connecticut, chiefly inhabited by presbyterians, who were generally civil to us; and after three days riding, we came amongst friends in the colony of Rhode-Island. We visited friends in and about Newport, and Dartmouth, and generally in those parts; and
then to Boston; and proceeded eastward as far as Dover: and then returned to Newport; and, not far from thence, we met our friend, Thomas Gawthrop, from England, who was then on a visit to these provinces. From Newport we sailed to Nantucket; were there near a week; and from thence came over to
Dartmouth: and, having finished our visit in these parts, we crossed the found from New-London to Long-Island; and, taking some meetings on the island, proceeded homeward; where we reached the thirteenth day of the seventh month, in the year 1747, having rode about fifteen hundred miles, and sailed about one hundred and fifty.
   In this journey, I may say, in general, we were sometimes in much weakness, and laboured under discouragements; and at other times, through the renewed manifestations of divine love, we had seasons of refreshment,
wherein the power of truth prevailed.
   We were taught, by renewed experience, to labour for an inward stillness; at no time to seek for words, but to live in the spirit of truth, and utter that to the people which truth opened in us. My beloved companion and I belonged to one meeting, came forth in the ministry near the same time, and were inwardly united in the work: he was about thirteen years older than I, bore the heaviest burthen, and was an instrument of the greatest use. 
   Finding a concern to visit friends in the lower counties on Delaware, and on the eastern shore of Maryland, and having an opportunity to join with my well-beloved ancient friend, John Sykesy we obtained certificates, and set off the seventh day of the eighth month; in the year 1748; were at the meetings of friends in the lower counties, attended the yearly meeting at Little-Creek, and made a visit to chief of me meetings on the eastern shore; and so home by the Way of Nottingham: were abroad about six weeks, and rode, by computation, about five hundred and fifty miles.
   Our exercise, at times, was heavy; but, through the goodness of the Lord, we were often refreshed: and I may say, by experience, "He is a strong hold in the day of trouble."
   Though our society, in these parts, appeared to me to be in a declining condition; yet, I believe, the Lord hath a people amongst them, who labour to serve him uprightly, but have many difficulties to encounter.
About this time, believing it good for me to settle, and thinking seriously about a companion, my heart was turned to the Lord with desires that he would give me wisdom to proceed therein agreeable to his wishes and he was pleased to give me a well- inclined damsel, Sarah Ellis; to whom I was married the eighteenth day of the eighth month, in the year 1749. 
   In the fall of the year 1750 died my father, Samuel Woolman, with a fever, aged about sixty years.
   In his life-time he manifested much care for us his children that in our youth we might learn to fear the Lord; often endeavouring to imprint in our minds the true principles of virtue, and particularly to cherish in us a spirit of tenderness, not only towards poor people, but also towards all creatures of which we had the command. 
   After my return from Carolina, in the year 1746, I made some observations on keeping slaves,, which some time before his decease I shewed him; and he perused the manuscript, proposed a few alterations, and appeared well
satisfied that I found a concern on that account: and in his last, sickness, as I was watching with him one night, he being so far spent that there was no expectation of his recovery, but having the perfect use of his understanding, he asked me concerning the manuscript, whether I expected soon to proceed to take the advice of friends in publishing it? and, after some conversation thereon, said, I have all along been deeply affected with the oppression of the poor negroes; and now, at last, my concern for them is as great as ever.
   By his direction, I had wrote his will in a time of health, and that night he desired me to read it to him, which I did; and he said it was agreeable to his mind. He then made mention of his end, which he believed was near; and signified, that, though he was sensible of many imperfections in the course
of his life, yet his experience of the power of truth, and of the love and goodness of God from time to time, even till now, was such, that he had no doubt but that, in leaving this life, he should enter into one more happy.
   The next day his sister Elizabeth came to see him, and told him of the decease of their sister Ann; who died a few days before: he then said, I reckon sister Ann was free to leave this world? Elizabeth said, she was: he then said, I also am free to leave it; and, being in great weakness of body, said, I hope
I shall shortly go to rest. He continued in a weighty frame of mind, and was sensible till near the last.
   On the second day of the ninth month, in the year 1751, feeling drawings in my mind to visit friends at the Great-Meadows, in the upper part of West-Jersey, with the unity of our monthly meeting, I went there; and had some searching laborious exercise amongst friends in those parts, and found inward peace therein.
   In the ninth month of the year 1753, in company with my well-esteemed friend, John Sykes, and with the unity of friends, we travelled about two weeks, visiting friends in Bucks-County. We laboured in the love of the gospel, according to the measure received; and, through the mercies of him, who is strength to the poor who trust in him, we found satisfaction in our visit: and, in the next winter, way opening to visit friends families within the compass of our monthly-meeting, partly by the labours of two friends from Pennsylvania, I joined in some part of the work; having had a desire some time that it might go forward amongst us.
   About this time, a person at some distance lying sick, his brother came to me to write his will: I knew he had staves; and, asking his brother, was told he intended to leave them as slaves to his children. As writing is a profitable employ, and as offending sober people was disagreeable to my inclination, I
was straitened in my mind; but, as I looked to the Lord, he inclined my heart to his testimony: and I told the man, that I believed the practice of continuing slavery to this people was not right; and had a scruple in my mind against doing writings of that kind: that, though many in our society kept them as slaves, still I was not easy to be concerned in it; and desired to be excused from, going to write the will. I spake to him in the fear of the Lord; and he made no reply to what I said, but went away: he, also, had some concerns in the practice; and I thought he was displeased with me. In this case I had a fresh confirmation, that acting contrary to present outward interest, from a motive of divine love, and in regard to truth and righteousness, opens the way to a treasure better than silver, and to a friendship exceeding the friendship of men.
   The manuscript before-mentioned having lain by me several years, the publication of it rested weightily upon me; and this year I offered it to the revisal of friends, who, having examined and made some small alterations in it, directed a number of copies thereof to be published, and dispersed amongst
friends.
   In the year 1754, I found my mind drawn to join in a visit to friends families belonging to Chesterfield monthly-meeting; and having the approbation of our own, I went to their monthly-meeting in order to confer with friends, and see if way opened for it; I had conference with some of their members, the proposal having been opened before in their meeting, and one friend agreed to
join with me as a companion for a beginning; but, when meeting was ended, I felt great distress of mind, and doubted what way to take, or whether to go home and wait for greater clearness: I kept my distress secret; and, going with a friend to his house, my desires were to the great Shepherd for his heavenly instruction; and in the morning I felt easy to proceed on the visit, being very
low in my mind: and as mine eye was turned to the Lord, waiting in families in deep-reverence before him, he was pleased graciously to afford help; so that we had many comfortable opportunities, and it appeared as a fresh visitation to some young people. I spent several weeks this winter in the service, part of which time was employed near home. And again, in the following winter, I was several weeks in the fame service; some part of the time at Shrewsbury, in company with my beloved friend, John Sykes; and have cause humbly to acknowledge, that, through the goodness of the Lord, our hearts were, at times, enlarged in his love; and strength was given to go through the trials which, in the course of our visits attended us.
   Scrupling to do writings, relative to keeping slaves, having been a means of sundry small trials to me, in which I have so evidently felt my own will set aside, I think it good to mention a few of them. � Tradesmen and retailers of goods, who depend on their business for a living, are naturally inclined to keep the good-will of their customers; nor is it a pleasant thing for young men to be under any necessity to question the judgement or honesty of elderly men, and
more especially of such as have a fair reputation. Deep-rooted customs, though wrong, are not easily altered; but it is the duty of every one to be firm in that which they certainly know is right for them. A charitable benevolent man, well acquainted with a negro, may, I believe, under some circumstances, keep him in his family as a servant, from no other motives than the negro's good; but man, as man, knows not what shall be after him, nor hath assurance that his children will attain to that perfection in wisdom and goodness necessary rightly to exercise such power: it is clear to me, that I ought not to be the scribe where wills are drawn, in which some children are made absolute masters over others during life. 
   About this time, an ancient man, of good esteem; in the neighbourhood, came to my house to get his will written; he had young negroes; and I asked him privately, how he purposed to dispose of them? he told me: I then said, I cannot write thy will without breaking my own peace; and respectfully gave him my reasons for it: he signified that he bad a choice, that I should have written it; but as I could not, consistent with my conscience, he did not desire it: and so he got it written by some other person. And, a few years aster, there being great alterations in his family, he came again to get me to write his will: his negroes were yet young; and his son, to whom he intended to give them,
was, since he first spoke to me, from a libertine, become a sober young man; and he supposed, that I would have been free, on that account, to write it. We had much friendly talk on the subject, and then deferred it: a few days after, he came again, and directed their freedom; and then I wrote his will.
   Near the time the last-mentioned friend first spoke to me, a neighbour received a bad bruise in his body, and sent for me to bleed him; which being done, he desired me to write his will: I took notes; and, amongst other things, he told me to which of his children he gave his young negro: I considered, the pain and distress he was in, and knew not how it would end; so I wrote his will, save only that part concerning his slave, and, carrying it to his bed-side, read it to him; and then told him, in a friendly way, that I could not write any instruments by which my fellow-creatures were made slaves, without bringing trouble on my own mind: I let him know that I charged nothing for what I had
done; and desired to be excused from doing the other part in the way he proposed: we then had a serious conference on the subject; at length he agreeing to set her free, I finished his will.
Having found drawings in my mind to vint
friends on Long-Island, after obtaining a certi-
ficate from our monthly-meeting, I set off on
the twelfth day of the fifth month, in the year
1756. When'I reached the island, I Totfged
the first night at the house of my dear friend',
Richard Hallet: the next day, being the first
of the week, I was at the meeting' in; New-
town; in which we experienced the renewed
manifestations of the love of Jesus Christ, to
the comfort of the honest-hearted. I went
that night to Flushing; and the next day> in
company with my beloved friend, Matthew
Franklin, we crossed the ferry at Whke.Stone;
Were at three meetings on the main, and then
returned to the island � where I spent the re-
mainder of the week in visiting meetings. The
Lord, 1 believe, hath a people in those parts,
who ate honestly inclined to serve him; but
many, .1 fear, are too much clogged with the
things.of this life, and do not come forward
bearing the cross in such faithfulness as he calls
for.
My mind was deeply engaged in this visit,
both in public and private; and, at several
places, observing that they had Haves, I found
myself under a necessity, in a friendly way, to
labour with them on that subject j express-
ing, as way opened, the inconsistency of that
practice with the purity of the Christian re-
ligion, and the ill effects of it manifested
amongst us.
The latter end of the week, their yearly-
meeting began 5 at which were our friend9
John Scarbrough, Jane Hofkins, and Susan-
nah Brown, from Pennsylvania: the public
meetings were large, aqd measurably favoured
with divine goodness.
The exercise of my mind, at this meeting,
was chiefly on account of those who were
considered as the foremost rank in the soci-
ety: and, in a meeting of ministers and el-
ders, way opened, that I expressed in some
measure what lay upon me j and, at a time
when friends were met for transacting the
affairs of the church, having set a while si-
lent, I felt a weight on my mind, and stood
up j and, through the gracious regard of our
heavenly Father, strength was given fully to
clear myself of a burthen, which, for some
days, had been increasing upon me. v^
Through the humbling dispensations of
divine Providence, men are sometimes sitted
for his service. The messages of the prophet
Jeremiah were so disagreeable to the people,
and so reverse to the spirit they lived in, that
he became the object of their reproach j and,
in the weakness of nature, thought of desist-
ing from his prophetic ofsice j but, faith he,
f His word was in my heart as a burning
"sire (hut up in my bones; and I was weary
"with forbearing, and could not stay." 11
saw at this time, that, if I was honest in deT
daring that which truth opened in me, I
could not please all. men; and laboured to
be content in the way of my duty, however
disagreeable to my own inclination. After
this I went homeward, taking Woodbridge
and Plainsield jn my way; in both which
meetings, the pure influence of divine love
was manifested j in an humbling fense where-
of I went home; having been out about twen-
ty-four days, and rode about three hundred
and sixteen miles. ..
While I was out on this journey, my heart
was much affected with a fense of the state
of the churches in our southern provinces;
and, believing the Lord was calling me to
some farther labour amongst them, 1 was
bowed in reverence before him, with fervent
desires that I might sind strength to resign my-
self up to his heavenly will.
Until this year, 1756, I continued to re-
tail goods, besides following my trade as a
taylor; about which time, I grew uneasy
on account of my business growing too cum-
bersome. I had begun with selling trim-
mings for garments, and from thence pro-
ceeded to fell cloths and linens -, and, at
length, having got a considerable shop of goods,
nay trade increased every year, and the roatitd
large business appeared open-j but I feit a rtdj*
m my mind.
Through the mercies of the Almighty, 1
had, in a good degree, learned to be content
with a plain way of living: 1 had' but a small
family; and, on serious consideration, I belie-
ved truth did not require me to engage iri
much cumbering affairs: it had been my ge'-f
neral practice to buy and fell things really use-
ful: things that served chiefiy to please the vain
mind in people, I Was not easy to trade in >
seldom did itj and, whenever i did, I found it
weaken me as a Christian.
The increase of business beCasme my bur-
then j for, though my natural inclination was-
toward merchandize, yet I believed1 truth rei
quired me to live more free from outward
cumbers: and there was now a strife in my
mind between thetwO? and in this exercise
my prayers were put up to the Lord, who
graciously heard me, and gave me a heart re-
signed to his holy will: then 1 lessened myt
outward business j and, as I had opportuni-
ty, told my customers of my intention, that
they might consider what (hop to turn to:
and, in a while, wholly laid down merchan-
dize, following my trade, as a taylor, myself
only, having no apprentice. I also had a
nursery of apple-trees j in which I employed
some of my time in hoeing, grafting, trim-
ming, and inoculating. Iii merchandize it
is the custom, where I lived, to fell chiefly
on credit, and posr people often get In debt j
and when payment is expected, not having
wherewith to pay, their creditors often sue
for it at law. Having often observed occur-
rences of this kind, I found it good for me.
to advise poor people to take such goods as
were most useful a,nd not costly.
In the time of trading, I had an opportu-
nity of seeing, that the too liberal use of spi-
rituous liquors, and. the custom of wearing
too costly apparel, led some people into great
inconveniences; and these two things appear
to be often connected; for, by not attending
to that use of things which is consistent
with universal righteousness, there Is an in-
crease of labour which extends beyond what
our heavenly Father intends for us: and
by; great labour, and often by much sweat-
ing, there is, even among such as are
not drunkards, a craving of some liquors to
revive the spirits: that, partly by the luxuri-
ous drinking of some, and partly by the
drinking of others, (led to it through immo-
derate labour,) very great quantities of rum
are every year expended in our colonies; the
greater part of which we should have no need
of, did we steadily attend to pure wisdom.
Where men take pleasure in feeling their
minds elevated with strong drink, and so in-
dulge their appetite as to disorder their un-
derstandings, neglect their duty as members
jn a family or civil society, and cast off all
regard to religion, their j:ase is much to be
pitied j and where such, whose lives are foF E � the me\ 'm6ft past regular, ana* whose examples
have a strong influence on the minds of
others, adhere to some customs which power-
fully draw to the use of more strong liquor
than pure wisdom allows; this also, as it
hinders the spreading of the spirit of meek-
ness, and strengthens the hands of the more
excessive drinkers, is a case to be lamented.
As every degree oTluxury hath some con-
nexion with evil, those who profess to be
disciples of Christ, and are looked upon as
leaders of the people, mould have that mind in
them which was also in Christ, and so stand
separate from every wrong way, as a means
of help to the weaker. As I have sometimes
been much spent in the heat, and taken spi-
rits to revive me, I have found, by experi-
ence, that in such circumstances the mind is
not so calm, nor so fitly disposed for divine
meditation, as when all such extremes are
avoided j and I have felt an increasing care
to attend to that holy Spirit which sets
bounds to our desires, and leads those, who
faithfully follow it, to apply all the gifts of
divine Providence to the purposes for which
they were intended. Did such, as have the
care of great estates, attend with singleness
of heart to this heavenly Instructor, which
so opens and enlarges the mind, that men
love their neighbours as themselves, they
would have wisdom given them to manage*
without finding occasion to employ some peo*
pie in the luxuries of life, or to make it ne-
cessary for others to labour too hard; but, for
want of steadily regarding.this principle of
divine love, a selfish spirit takes place in the
minds of people, which is attended with
darkness and manifold confusion in the
world.
Though trading in thing? useful is an ho-
nest employ; yet, through the great number
of superfluities which are bought and fold,
and through the corruption of the times,
they, who apply to merchandize for a living,
have great need to be. well experienced in that
precept which the prophet Jeremiah laid down
for his (bribe: "Seekest thou great things for
"thyself? seek them not."
