ARISTIDES
Sir,
I have a few thoughts to communicate, first to yourself, and after that, if you please to the public, upon the manner of conducting what is now called the independent controversy, in the newspapers. There are to be found in the tracks upon one side of this question, almost without exception, complaints of some restraints, felt or feared, upon the freedom of the press. I shall be glad to be informed, because I am yet ignorant, what foundation there is for these complaints. A pamphlet was published some time ago, calling itself Common Sense, which nobody was obliged to read, but those who are willing to pay for it, and that pretty dearly too. It was however read very generally, which I suppose must have arisen either from the beauty and elegance of the composition, or from the truth and importance of the matter contained in it. That it did not arise from the first of these causes, I shall take for granted, until I meet with somebody who is of a different opinion; and when this is added to the circumstance of its being sold in the manner above mentioned, it is plain that the subject matter of Common Sense was proposed to the world under every disadvantage, but that of its own manifest importance and apparent truth or probability.
Things being in this situation, after time sufficient to have matured any pamphlet of an ordinary size, outcomes an answer to Common Sense, under the title of Plain Truth. This in one respect, was perfectly fair, for it was pamphlet against pamphlet; in the said Plain Truth also was sold, as well as Common Sense, at a very high price. For this last circumstance, there is no need of assigning a reason, because I apprehended is the undoubted right of every author, to set what price he pleases upon the productions of his genius, and of every printer upon the productions of his press, leaving it always to the public to determine whether they will purchase these productions at any price, or any other. A reason however was assigned, which was as singular as it was unnecessary. We were told that only a small number of copies was printed of the first addition, I believe this is the only instance that can be produced, of calling a book in its publication, the first edition. The only reason of making more additions than one of any book, is the speedy sale of that number of copies, which the modesty of the author, where the prudence of the bookseller, thought might be sufficient for the public demand. In this case, there is what is stated by the printers a call for another edition. But there are multitudes of publications, as to which this call is never heard, and therefore none of them can, with propriety of speech be stiled the first edition. How could it sound if I should say, that a man who came alone into my house, was the first of the company that entered; or that my wife, who is still alive and well, is my first wife, it is very possible that she may live till I am unfit for any other wife, or till she is at liberty to take her second husband?
But further, supposing that the author and bookseller had been right in that expectation, which the use of the phrase plainly shews the vanity of the one in the mistake of the other had raised in them, I desire to know how that was a reason for printing few copies, and thus rendering them unconscionably dear. You printers know best, but I take it for granted from the nature of the thing, that you print fewest copies of a book, when you do not expect a general sale. If I were certain that this dissertation of mine would cause an unusual demand for the paper that contains it, I would modestly suggest to you, to print three or four hundred of that number more than common. In like manner, if it was certain at the appearance of this pamphlet, that it would be the first of many editions, following one another in rapid succession, it seems the most obvious thing in the world at the addition should have been as large as possible. Upon the whole, this was an unlucky stumble at the threshold in the author of Plain Truth, as well as an unexpected lapsus of the great, illustrious, and exalted R.B. providore, as he calls himself, to the sentimentalists, for which I find no way of accounting, but that they were inadvertently led by the subject they had in hand to act, as well as right, in direct opposition to Common Sense.
Well, the book comes out, of which I had a president of two copies, from different persons, notwithstanding the smallness of the number printed. But what shall I say, either of the style or reasoning of the performance. The reading of three pages gave me the opinion of it, which all who read it afterwards coneurred in, in which all who have not read it, easily acquiesced in. In execution it was so contemptible, that he could not procure reading on the subject, as to which, the curiosity of the public was raised to the greatest height; it not only wanted good qualities in point of taste and propriety, but was eminently possessed of every bad one. Common Sense sometimes failed in grammar, but never in perspicuity. Plain Truth was so ridiculously ornamented with vapid, senseless phrases and feeble epithets, that his meeting could hardly be comprehended. He often put me in mind of the painted windows of some old Gothic buildings, which keep out the light. If Common Sense in some places wanted polish, Plain Truth was covered over, from head to foot, with a detestable and stinking varnish.
As to the argument itself, although nothing could be more clearly stated that it was in Common Sense, yet in Plain Truth it was never touched upon in the least degree. The author of Common Sense did not write his book to shew that we ought to resist the unconstitutional claims of Great Britain, which we had all determined to do long before; he wrote it to shew that we ought not to seek or wait for reconciliation, which in his opinion, is now become both impracticable and unprofitable, but to establish a fixed regular government, and provide for ourselves � Plain Truth on the contrary, never attempt to shew that there is the least probability of obtaining reconciliation on such terms as will preserve and secure our liberties, but has exerted all his little force, to prove, that such is the strength of Great Britain, that it will be in vain for us to resist at all. I will refer it to the impartial judgment of all who have read this treatise, whether the just and proper inference from his reasoning is not, that we ought immediately to send and embassy with ropes about their necks, to make a full and humble surrender of ourselves and all our property to the disposal of the parent state. This they have formally and explicitly demanded of us, and this we have with equal clearness determined we will never do. The question then is; Shall we make resistance with the greatest force, as rebel subjects of a government which we acknowledge, or as independent states against an usurped power which we detest and abhor.
After this reprobate of author was off the stage, a new set of antagonists appeared against Common Sense? but instead of publishing the first edition of pamphlets, they chose to appear in the newspapers. The propriety of this I beg leave to examine. Much has been said about the liberty of the press; suffer me to say a few words for the liberty of readers. What a pamphlet is published and sold, nobody is wronged. When the answer to it is published and sold, the thing is quite fair. The writers and their cause will undergo an impartial trial; but when the answering one pamphlet by another, has so shamefully failed, to undertake the same thing by various detached pieces in the newspapers, is cramming the sense or nonsense of these authors down our throats, whether we will or not. I pay for your newspaper, and for two more, and frequently read others besides. Now, if I pay for news, as my paper be stuffed with dissertations, and must I read them four or five times over? I do declare, that I have paid, and him to pay, three times for the most part of Cato�s letters, and if they were to be published in a pamphlet, I would not give a rush for them all together. But it will be said, the custom is old and universal, to write dissertations in newspapers. I answer, it is both old, universal and useless, one under proper direction; but it may be abused. It is the right of every publisher of a newspaper, too insert in it upon his own judgment and choice, when news is scarce, whatever he thinks will recommend his paper to his readers. In this view, an able writer is a treasure to a publisher of any periodical paper, and ought certainly to be paid liberally, either in money or thanks, or both; and therefore, Sir, if you have paid for, or even solicited from the author, the papers you have published, you are wholly acquitted of blame, further than sometimes a mistaken choice; but if on the contrary, which I strongly suspect, you and others are paid for inserting political pieces, I affirm, you take money to deceive your readers.
As the subject is of some importance, especially at this time, I shall take the liberty of stating the objections I have against the practice, as above described, leaving you to shape your future course as you think proper, in determining to use my prerogative of taking or giving up your paper as it seems to deserve. In the first place, if you admit pieces into your paper for pay, I presume from the nature of all mankind, that those who pay best, will have the preference. Then shall we have a new standard of literary merit; and a man who is able and willing to refute pernicious principles, or to detect the falsehood of impudent assertions, may yet be too poor to obtain a place, or only it can be done to any good purposes. The moment it is in the power of persons unknown, to conduct or bias the public channels of intelligence, both the people in general, and particular persons, may be deceived and abused in the grossest manner. It is scarce worth while, when things of so much greater moment are to be added, get I will just mention, that you force nonsense upon us which could not make its appearance in any other mode of publication. Pray Sir, how much copy money would you have given for a pamphlet in which you had found that ridiculous upon upon Mount Seir, which is to be seen in one of Cato�s letters, and the wretched parity upon Hamlet�s soliloquy? Parity in general, is one of the lowest kind of writing that has yet found the name; and that poor speech has been repeated, imitated and mangled so often, that must excite discussed in every person who has any acquaintance with newspapers and pamphlets to see it again. I could easily mention twenty different ways, in which I have seen that speech parodied. To speak, or not to speak, that is the question � to fight, or not to fight, that is the question � to wed, are not to it, that is the question � to drink, or not to drink, that is the question, &c. &c. &c. Is this then a time for filling the newspapers with such egregious trifling?
But this is not all; I could mention that case that happened a few years ago in New-York. A gentleman had published a small piece by itself, and put his own name and description on the title page; he was immediately attacked the most virulent and on mannerly stile, by anonymous writers in the newspapers, and it was with the utmost difficulty, that even for pay itself, his friends could get a few words inserted by way of reply. This practice indeed, is liable to the highest degree of corruption. Whether are we to suppose it was pay or profane this, that introduced into the paper printed by the infamous R �, pieces containing the grossest obscenity, and which ought to have been punished by the magistrates of the place, as a public nuisance? It is also generally believed of that printer, that he encouraged or hired worthless persons to publish aspersions against a gentleman in the neighbourhood, of good estate, but of no great judgment, that he might squeeze money out of him for the liberty of contradicting them. I do not say that things are come this length with you; but the practice leads to it, and therefore should be early and vigorously opposed.
For the above reasons, caution is to be used in administrating essays into the newspapers at any rate, or suffering a controversy in which people are greatly interested, to be agitated there at all. The writers are very apt to become personal and abusive, and to forget the subject by refuting or exposing every thing that has been thrown out by their antagonists. Certainly however, they want to confine themselves to the pieces that have been originally published in the newspapers, and are supposed to have been read by the same persons who read the answers. To answer a whole book by a series of letters in the newspapers, is like attacking a man behind his back, and speaking to his prejudice before persons who never saw nor heard of them, nor ever likely so to do. Common Sense has been read by many, if the newspapers are read by many more; and therefore I affirm, the permitting his adversaries to attack him there, is giving him an undue advantage over him, and laying the public at the mercy of those who will not stick to assert any thing whatever, in support of a bad cause.
Let no body say I am writing against the freedom of the press. I desire that it should be perfectly free from every bias; but I would have all writings of consequence upon such a causes this, published by themselves, that they may stand or fall by their own merit, and the judgment of the public. How do you think Sir, the letter of the common man publishing your paper, some time ago, would do if lengthened out a little, and printed in a pamphlet? Under a thin and silly pretense of impartiality, he takes upon him to tell us what a number of things must be all previously settled, before we proceed to fix upon a regular plan of government; such as what price we must expect for our produce at this and the other nation and port. Joe we call this reasoning? Are our understandings to be insulted? If all or any such things must be previously settled, any man of common invention may enumerate fifty thousand perfectly similar, which will never be settled by previous computation to the end of the world, but will speedily settled themselves by common interest, when a trade is open, and the common man shall never know any thing of the matter.
But what I chiefly complain of, is the tedious, trifling, indecent altercation, occasioned by handling the subject in the newspapers. It certainly requires a speedy decision, as well as mature deliberation; yet must we wait till Cato and other writers have exhausted their invention in the newspapers, from week to week, guessed at one another�s persons, and triumphantly expressed their disdain at each other�s sentiments or stile. If Cato�s letters had been a pamphlet, I could have read all that he has said in an hour, and all the reasoning part by itself, in the fourth part of the time; yet after eight letters, must we wait some weeks more, for it would be indecent to proceed to actions before he is done speaking. But after all, the worst of it is, that in this way of letter and answer, we never come to the argument at all. If I mistake not, the points to be discussed are very plain and not numerous, and yet wholly untouched, at least by Cato, though he has been repeatedly called upon by his adversaries. For example � Is there a probable prospect of reconciliation on constitutional principles? What are these constitutional principles? Will any body shew that Great-Britain can be sufficiently sure of our dependence, and yet we sure of our liberties? A treatise upon this last subject would be highly acceptable to me, and if well executed, and useful to all. I shall add but one question more. Will the country be as orderly and happy, and our efforts for resistance as a sexual, by the present loose and temporary proceedings, as when the whole are united by a firm confederacy, and their exes or should this concentrated like the strength of a single state? I am greatly mistaken if these points ought not to be the hinge of the controversy, and yet if they have been examined fully, or the greatest part of them even touched upon by Cato and his coadjutors, I have read their works with very little attention.
Now, sir That, this paper goes to you, that if you please you may insert it, that neither money our promise of good deed to make way for it, so that its fate is wholly uncertain.
I remain Sir,
Yours, &c.
