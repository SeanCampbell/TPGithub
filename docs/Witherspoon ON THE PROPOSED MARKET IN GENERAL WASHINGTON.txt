ON THE PROPOSED MARKET IN GENERAL WASHINGTON�S CAMP
To his Excellency General Washington, and the Officers of the American Army
Sir,
About ten days ago, I was informed that you were consulting with the farmers in the neighborhood, and laying a plan for holding a market at the camp. This was to me, the most pleasing news I have heard from camp for a long time. I supposed that you had now discovered the true and proper way of providing comforts and refreshments to your soldiers, which, pardon me, I think has hitherto, in God�s most holy will, in hid from your eyes. Last week�s news-paper brought us the plan, in which I have been so much disappointed, that I�ve taken pen in hand, to make a few remarks upon it, and submit them to your view. Rest assured that they come from a firm friend to American liberty, who has felt the tyranny of general Howe, and therefore hold him and his cause in detestation. You are not to expect from a plane country farmer, high sounding language, and well turned phrases � It is possible I may be held in derision for this, but some of your learned generals; for I am told you have some who can write full as well as they could fight, perhaps better; but that however as it may, you mean to write only of what I think I understand, and shall make use of the plainest words possible, that I may be understood.
I must begin by saying, that if you are under any difficulty in supplying your army, either with the necessaries or conveniencies of life, it is wholly owing to mistaken principles, or unfaithful conduct in the manner of procuring them. You are in the midst of a plentiful country � You commanded by your sword, except a small spot in which the enemy is confined; and I most heartily with you would pen them in closer than you do. � You have also the hearts of the country; for let people talk as they please of the number of tories, they are altogether inconsiderable to the friends of liberty, in every state in this continent. When the English army leaves any place, we do not need your army to conquer it for us. All that were friends to them, fly with them, or skulk into corners, trembling for their lives. Let us consider then how the matter stands � Your army consists, I shall suppose at present, of 20,000 men; for though it was considerably larger lately, I reckon from the number: home on recruiting parties, and for other reasons, that may be about or near the truth. Suppose it however 25,000; if these were distributed one in every house, for the twenty-five thousand houses that are nearest to the camp, they would not reach so far east as the Delaware, nor so far west as Lancaster; and though no provisions were brought into that space on their account, they could be well fed, and the burden never felt. This shows that the whole difficulty arises from the necessity of procuring and transporting provisions to such a number of man collected together in one place, a difficulty which one would think might be easily surmounted. It is not my intention at present, to make remarks on the commissary�s department for supplying the capital necessaries, though I want not inclination. Suffice it to say, that for refreshments and smaller necessaries, you are now making an attempt towards the only effectual way, viz. a market, or in other words, inviting people to bring them to you of their own accord.
Now, Sir, I have read and considered your plan, the chief part of which is settling the prices of a variety of articles, which is expected will be exposed to sale. Fixing the price of commodities, has been attempted by law in several states among us, and it has increased the evil it was meant to remedy, as the same practice ever has done is the beginning of the world. Such laws, when they only say man shall be punished if they sell at any higher prices than the legal, and that if any will not sell at these prices, their goods shall be taken by force, have some meaning in them, the little wisdom: but to publish a list of fixed prices, as an encouragement to a weekly market, is a new strain of policy indeed. If people bring their goods to market, and are willing to sell them at these, or lower prices, is not that enough? and if they are not willing to sell, how shall they be made willing to come? Probably you were told these were reasonable prices; now I shall be glad to know what you call a reasonable price. If it be that which is proportioned to the demand on the one side, and the plenty more scarcity of goods on the other, I agree to it; but I affirm that this will fix of itself, by the consent of the buyer and seller, better than it can be done by any politician upon earth. If you mean any thing else, it signifies nothing at all, whether it be reasonable or not; for if it is not agreeable, as well as reasonable, you might have one market day, but not a second. There are some things which are not the object of human laws, and such are all those that essentially depends for this success upon inward inclination. Laws, force, or any kind of limitation, are so far from having any tendency of themselves, to persuade or incline, that they have generally the contrary effect. It would be much to the advantage of many lawgivers and other persons in authority, if they would carefully distinguish between what it is to be affected by force, and what by persuasion, and never preposterously mix these opposite principles, and defeat the operation of both. Laws and authority compel; but it is reason interest that must persuade.
The fixing of prices by authority, is not only impolitic, as I have shewn above, what it is in itself unreasonable and absurd. There are so many different circumstances to be taken in to constitute equality or justice in such matters, that they cannot be all attended to, or even ascertained. The plenty of one kind of provision, and scarcity of another � The plenty in one corner of the country, and scarcity in another � the distance of one place, and nearness of another � The changes of circumstances in the course of a few weeks or days � Good or bad roads, or good or bad weather � The comparative quality of the goods � These, and an hundred other circumstances which can never be foreseen, actually govern the prices of goods at market, and ought to govern them. If a price is just to one who brings his goods fifteen miles, it is certainly too much for one who brings them only one. If �.10 per pound is a just price for veal at present, I am certain it must be too much of month hence, when veal will be much more plentiful. If one shilling and four pence per pound is reasonable for a fat turkey, what not I have to have more for fatter, which is both better in its quality and weight � being later to its bulk, because that is not so heavy as either lean flesh or bones. If it is reasonable to pay me one shilling per pound for any need in a good day, I shall expect more if I go out in a storm; if not, I will stay at home on a bad day, and so you must starve one week, and pamper the next.
All the circumstances you must allow to restrain and limit one another. He who is nearest, and has goods in plenty, we�ll be selling cheap, moderate the demands of him comes far. If you pay very dear for any article one day, the news of that spreading abroad, brings in the digits quantities, and the price falls, and so it happens in every other case. Thus it appears that it is out of your power to tell what is a reasonable price, and by attempting to do it, you not only refuse to gratify the expectations of the people, but you treat them with unjustice.
I have one more remark to make upon the subject; that to fix the prices of goods, especially provisions in a market, is as impracticable as it is unreasonable. The whole persons concerned, buyers and sellers, will use every art to defeated, and will certainly succeed.
