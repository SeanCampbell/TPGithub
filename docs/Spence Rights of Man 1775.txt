It being my turn to lecture, I beg to give some thoughts on this important question, viz. whether mankind in society, reap all the advantages from their natural and equal rights of property in land and liberty, which in that state they possibly may, and what to expect? And as I hope you, Mr. Pres. And the good company here are sincere friends to truth, I am under no apprehensions of giving offense by defending her cause with freedom.

That property in land and liberty among men, in a state of nature, ought to be equal, few, one would fain hope, would be foolish enough to deny. Therefore, taking this to be granted, the country of any people, in a native state, is properly their comment, in which each of them has an equal property, with free liberty to sustain himself and connexions with the animals, fruits, and other products thereof. Thus such a people read jointly the whole advantages of their country, or neighbourhood, without having their right in so doing called in question by any, not even by the most selfish and corrupted. For upon what must they live, if not upon the productions of the country in which they reside? Surely to deny them that right is, in effect, denying them a right to live.  � Well, methinks some are now ready to say, but it is not lawful, reasonable, and just for this people to sell, or make a present, even of the whole of their country, or, and, to whom they will, to be held by them and their heirs, even for ever?

To this I answer, if there posterity require no grosser materials to live and move upon than air, it would, certainly be very ill-natured, to dispute their right of parting with what of their own, their posterity would never have occasion for; but if there posterity cannot live but as grossly as they do, the same gross materials must be left them to live upon. For right to deprive any thing of the means of living supposes a right to deprive it of life; and this rate ancestors are not supposed to have over their posterity.

Hence it is plain, that the land or Earth, in any country or neighbourhood, with every thing in or on the same, or pertaining thereto, belongs at all times to the living inhabitants of the said country or neighbourhood in an equal manner. For, as I said before, there is no living but I land and its productions, consequently what we cannot live without, we have the same property and, as in our lives.

Now I society ought properly to be nothing but a mutual agreement among the inhabitants of the country, to maintain the natural rights and privileges of one another against all opposers, whether foreign or domestic, it should lead one to expect to find those rights and privileges, no farther infringed upon, among man pretending to be in that state, the necessity absolutely required. I say again, it should lead one to think so. But I am afraid, whoever does will be mightily mistaken. However, as the truth here is of much importance to be known, let it be boldly sought out; in order to which, it may not be improper to trace the present method of holding land among men in society, from its original.

If we look back to the origin of the present nations, we shall see that the land, with all its appurtenances, was claimed by a few, and divided among themselves, in as short a manner, as if they had manufactured it, and it had been the work of their own hands, and by being unquestioned, were not called to an account for such usurpations and unjust claims, they fell into a habit of thinking, or which is the same thing, to the rest of mankind, of acting as if the earth was made for or by them, and did not scruple to call it their own property, which they might dispose of without regard to any other living creature in the universe. Accordingly they did so, and no man, more than any other creature, could claim a right to so much as a blade of grass, or and not Lauren acorn, a fish or fowl, or any natural production whatever, though to save his life, without the permission of the pretended proprietor; and not a foot of land, water, rock, or Heath, but was claimed by one or the other of those lords; so that all things, men as well as other creatures who live, were obliged to owe their lives to some more others property, consequently they like the creatures were claimed, and certainly as properly as the wood, herbs, etc. that were nourished by the soil. And so we find, that whether they lived, multiplied, worked, or fought, it was all for their respective lords, and they, God bless them, was graciously accepted of all is there due. For by granting the means of life, they granted the life itself, and of course they thought they had a right to all the services and advantages that the life or death of the creatures they gave life to could yield.

Thus the title of God seems suitably enough applied to such great beings; nor is it to be wondered at that no services could be foot to great by poor, dependent, needy wretches to such mighty and all-sufficient lords, in whom they seem to live and move and have their being. Thus where the first land-holders usurpers and tyrants; and all who have since those asked their lands, have done so by right of inheritance, purchase, etc. from them, and the present proprietors, like their predecessors, are proud to own it; and like them to, they exclude all others from the least pretense to their respective properties. Any one of them still 10 bylaws of their own making, oblige every living creature to remove office property, (which, to the great distress of mankind, is too often put to execution) so of consequence, were all the land � holders to be of one mind, and determined to take their properties into their own hands, all the rest of mankind might go to heaven if they would, for there would be no place found for them here. This man may not live in any part of this world, not even where they are born but as strangers and by the permission of the pretender to the property thereof; which permission is for the most part paid extravagantly for, and they are still advancing the terms of permission, the many people are so straitened to pay the present demands, that it is believed in a short time, if they hold on, there will be few to grant the favor to. And those land � makers, as we shall call them, justify all this by the practice of other manufacturers, take all they can get for the products of their hands, because that everyone ought to live by his business as well as you can, and consequently so what land � makers. Not having before supposed it both proved and allowed, that mankind have as equal and just a property in land as they have in liberty, air, or the light and heat of the sun, and having also considered upon what heart conditions they enjoy those common gifts of nature, it is plain they are far from reaping all the advantages from them, which they may and ought to expect.
But lest it should be said, that a system whereby they may reap more damages consistent with the nature of society cannot be proposed, I will attempt to shew the outlines of such a plan. B suppose the van, that the whole people in some country, after much reasoning and deliberation, should conclude, that every man has equal property in the land in the neighbourhood where he resides. They therefore resolve, that if they live in society together, it shall only be with the view, that everyone may reap all the benefits from their natural rights and privileges possible. Therefore, a day is appointed on which the inhabitants of each parish needs, in their respective parishes, to take their long-lost rights into possession, and to form themselves into corporations. So, then each parish becomes a Corporation, and all the men who are inhabitants become members or burghers. The land with all that app pertains to it, is in every parish, made the property of the corporation or parish with as ample power to left, repair or alter all, or any part thereof as a Lord of the Manor enjoys over his lands, houses, etc. but the power of alienating the least morsel, in any manner, from the parish, either at this or any time hereafter, is denied. For it is solemnly agreed to, by the whole nation, that a parish that shall either sell, or give away, any part of this landed property, shall be looked upon with as much horror and detestation, and used by them as if they had sold all their children to be slaves, were massacred them with their own hands. Thus are there no more nor other landlord, in the whole country than the parishes; and each of them is sovereign landlord of its own territories.

There you may behold the rent, which the people be paid into the parish treasuries employed by each parish in paying the government its share of the sum, which the parliament were national Congress at any time grants; in maintaining and relieving its own poor, and people out of work; in paying the necessary officers their salaries; in building, repairing, and adorning it�s houses, bridges, and other structures; in making and maintaining convenient and delightful streets, highways, and passages both for foot and carriages; in making and maintaining canals, and other conveniences for trade and navigation; implanting and taking in waste grounds; in providing and keeping up a magazine of ammunition and all sorts of arms sufficient for all its inhabitants in case of danger from enemies; in premiums for the encouragement of agriculture, or anything else thought worthy of encouragement; and, in a word, in doing whatever the people think proper; and not as formerly, to support and spread luxury, pride, and all manner of vice. As for corruption in elections, it is now no being or effect among them; all affairs to be determined by voting either in a full meeting of the parish, its committees, or in the house of representatives are done by balloting, to that boating�s, or elections among them, occasion no animosities, for none need to let another know for which side he votes; all that can be done, therefore, in order to gain a majority of votes for any thing, is to make it appear in the best light possible by speaking or writing. Among them government does not meddle in every trifle, but on the contrary, allows to each parish the power of putting the laws in force in all cases, and does not interfere, but when they act manifestly to the prejudice of society, and the rights and liberties of mankind as established in their glorious Constitution and laws. For the judgment of the parish may be as much depended upon as that of a House of Lords, because they have as little to fear from speaking or voting according to truth, as they.

A certain number of neighbouring parishes, as those in a town or county, have each an equal vote in the election of persons to represent them in Parliament, Senate, or Congress: and each of them pays equally towards their maintenance. They are chosen thus: all the candidates are proposed in every parish on the same day, when the election by balloting immediately precedes in all the parishes that wants to prevent two great concourse at one place, and they who are found to have the majority on a proper survey of the several poll books are acknowledged to be their representatives. 
A man by dwelling a whole year in any parish becomes a parishioner, or member of its Corporation; and retains that privilege, so he live a full year in some other, when he becomes a member of that parish, and immediately loses all his right to the former for ever, unless he chuse to go back and recover it, by drawing again a full year there. Thus none can be a member of two parishes that want; and yet a man is always a member of one, though he moved ever so oft.
If in any parish should be dwelling strangers from foreign nations, or people from distant parishes, who by sickness or other casualties should become so necessitous as to require release before they have acquired a settlement by dwelling a full year therein; then this parish, as it were their proper settlement, immediately takes them under its humane protection, and the expenses thus incurred by any parish in providing for those not properly their own poor being taken account of, is discounted by the exchequer, out of the first payment made to the state. Thus poor strangers being the poor of the state, are not looked upon with an envious evil I left they should become burthensome; neither are the poor harassed about the extremity of distress, and perhaps in a dying condition, to gratify the litigiousness of parishes.

All the men in every parish, at times of their own chusing, repair together, to a field for that purpose, with their officers, arms, banners, and all sorts of martial music, in order to learn, or retain the complete art of war: there they become soldiers! It not to molest their neighbours unprovoked, but to be able to defend what non-have a right to dispute, their title to the enjoyment of; and woe be to them who occasion them to do this! they would use them worse than highwaymen, or Pirates, if they got them in their power.

There is no Army kept in pay among them, in times of peace; as all have property you like to defend, they are alike ready to run to arms when their country is in danger: and when an Army is to be sent abroad, it is soon raised, of ready retrained soldiers, either as volunteers, or by casting lots in each Parish for so many men.

Besides, as each man has a vote in all the affairs of his parish, and for his own take must with weil to the public, the land is let in very small farms, which makes employment for greater number of hands, and makes more victualing of all kinds be raised .

There are no tolls or taxes of any kind pain among them, by native or foreigner, but the aforesaid rent, which every person pays to the parish, according to the quantity, quality, and conveniences of the land, housing, etc. which he occupies in it. The government, poor, roads, etc. etc. I said before, are all maintained, by the parishes with the rent; on which account, all where�s, manufactures, allowable trade, employments, or actions, are entirely duty- free. Freedom to do any thing whatever cannot there be bought; the thing is either entirely prohibited as theft, or murder; or entirely free to everyone without tax or price! and, the rents are still not so high, notwithstanding all that is done with them, as they were formerly for only the maintenance of a few haughty, unthankful landlords. For the government, which may be said to be the greatest mouth, having neither excise men, custom � housemen, collectors, Army, pensioners, bribery, nor suchlike ruin-nation vermin to maintain, is soon satisfied, and, moreover, there are no more persons employed in offices, either about the government or parishes, then are absolutely necessary; and their salaries are but just sufficient to maintain them suitably to their offices. And as to the other charges, they are but trifles, and might be increased or diminished at pleasure.

But though the rent, which includes all public burdens, were obliged to be somewhat raised, what then? All other nations have the devouring landed interest in support besides those necessary expenses of the public; and they might be raised very high indeed before their burden would be as heavy as that of their neighbours, who pay rent and taxes too. And it surely would be the same, for a person in any country to pay for instance an increase of rent if required, as to pay the same some by little and little upon every thing he gets.  � It would certainly save him a great deal of trouble and inconvenience, and government much expense.

But what makes this prospect yet more glorious is, that after this empire of right and reason is thus established, it will stand forever. Forcing corruption attempting down �fall, shall equally be baffled, and all other nations struck with wonder and admiration at its happiness and stability, shall follow the example; and thus the whole earth shall at last be happy, and live like brethren.
