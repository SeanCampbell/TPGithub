1st. month, 1759. Having found my mind drawn to visit some of the more active members in our society at Philadelphia, who had slaves, I met my friend John Churchman there by agreement; and we continued about a week in the city. We visited some that were sick, and some widows and their families; and the other part of our time was mostly employed in visiting such as had slaves. It was a time of deep exercise, but looking often to the Lord for his assistance, He in unspeakable kindness, favoured us with the influence of that spirit,
which crucifies to the greatness and splendour of this world, and enabled us to go through some heavy labours, in which we found peace.
   24th of 3rd mo. 1759. After attending our general spring meeting at Philadelphia, I again joined with John Churchman on a visit to some who had slaves in Philadelphia; and, with thankfulness to our heavenly father, I may say, that divine love and a true sympathizing tenderness of heart, prevailed at times in this service.
   Having at times perceived a shyness in some friends of considerable note towards me, I found an engagement in gospel love to pay a visit to one of them; and as I dwelt under the exercise, I felt a resignedness in my mind to go and tell him privately that I had a desire to have an opportunity with him alone; to this proposal he readily agreed: and then in the fear of the Lord, things relating to that shyness were searched to the bottom ; and we had a large conference, which, I believe was of use to both of us; and I am thankful that way was opened for it. 
   14th of 6th mo. Having felt drawings in my mind to visit friends about Salem, and having the approbation of our monthly meeting, I attended their quarterly meeting, and was out seven days, and attended seven meetings; in some of them I was chiefly silent; in others, through the baptizing power
of truth, my heart was enlarged in heavenly love, and I found a near fellowship with the brethren and sisters, in the manifold trials attending their Christian progress through this world.
   7th mo. I have found an increasing concern on my mind to visit some active members in our society who have slaves; and having no opportunity of the company of such as were named in the minutes of the yearly meeting, I went alone to their houses, and, in the fear of the Lord, acquainted them with the exercise I was under : and thus, sometimes, by a few words, I found myself discharged from a heavy burden. After this, our friend John Churchman coming into our province with a view to be at some meetings, and to join again in the visit to those who had slaves ; I bore him company in the said visit to some active members, and found inward satisfaction.
   At our yearly meeting this year, we had some weighty seasons; in which the power of truth was largely extended, to the strengthening of the honest-minded. As the epistles, which were to be sent to the yearly meetings on this continent were read, I observed that in most of them, both this year and
the last, it was recommended to friends to labour against buying and keeping slaves ; and in some of them the subject was closely treated upon. As this practice hath long been a heavy exercise to me, and I have often waded through mortifying labours on that account; and at times in some meetings have been almost alone therein, I was humbly bowed in thankfulness in observing the increasing concern in our religious society, and seeing how the Lord was raising up and qualifying servants 'or his work, not only in this respect, but for promoting the cause of truth in general.
   This meeting continued near a week. For several days in the forepart of it, my mind was drawn into a deep, inward stillness; and being at times covered with the spirit of supplication, my heart was secretly poured out before the Lord, near the conclusion of the meeting for business, way opened, in the pure Sowings of divine love, for me to express what lay upon me; which as it then arose in my mind, was first to show how deep answers to deep in the hearts of the sincere and upright; though, in their different growths, they may not ail
lave attained to the same clearness in some points relating to our testimony. And I was then led to mention the integrity and constancy of many martyrs, who gave their lives for the testimony of Jesus: and yet, in some points, they held doctrines distinguishable from some which we hold; that, in all ages, where people were faithful to the light and understanding which the Most High afforded them, they found acceptance, with Him; and though there may be different ways of thinking amongst us in some particulars, yet, if we mutually keep to that spirit and power which crucifies to the world, which
teaches us to be content with things really needful, and to avoid all superfluities, and give up our hearts to fear and serve the Lord, true unity may still be preserved amongst us: that if those who were at times under sufferings on account of some scruples of conscience, kept low and humble, and in their conduct in life manifested a spirit of true charity; it would be more likely to reach the witness in others, and be of more service in the church, than if their sufferings were attended with a contrary spirit and conduct. In this exercise I was drawn into a sympathizing tenderness with the sheep of Christ, however distinguished one from another in this world; and the like disposition appeared to spread over others in the meeting.
   Great is the goodness of the Lord towards his poor creatures. An epistle went forth from this yearly meeting, which I think good to give a place in this journal.
On the 8th of 6 mo. 1772, we landed at London, and I went straightway to the yearly meeting of ministers and elders, which had been gathered, I suppose, about half an hour.
   In this meeting my mind was humbly contrite. In the afternoon the meeting for business was opened, which by adjournments held near a week. In these meetings I often felt a living concern for the establishment of friends in the
pure life of truth. My heart was enlarged in the meeting of ministers, that for business, and in several meetings for public worship; and I felt my mind united in truelove, to the faithful labourers now gathered at this yearly meeting. On the 15th I went to a quarterly meeting at Hertford. 
   1st of 7 mo. I have been at quarterly meetings at Sherrington, Northampton, Banbury, and Shipton; and have had sundry meetings between. My mind hath been bowed under a sense of Divine goodness manifested among us; my heart hath been often enlarged in true love, both among ministers and elders, and in public meetings; and through the Lord's goodness, I believe it hath been a fresh visitation to many, in particular to the youth.
   17th. I was this day at Birmingham; I have been at meetings at Coventry, Warwick, in Oxfordshire, and sundry other places, and have felt the humbling hand of the Lord upon me; but through his tender mercies I find peace in the
labours I have gone through. 
   26th. I have continued travelling northward, visiting meetings. Was this day at Nottingham ; the forenoon meeting was especially, through Divine love, a heart-tendering season. Next day I had a meeting in a friends' family, which,
through the strengthening arm of the Lord, was a time to be thankfully remembered.
   2nd of 8th mo. and 1st of the week. I was this day at Sheffield, a large inland town. I was at sundry meetings last week, and feel inward thankfulness for that Divine support, which hath been graciously extended to me. On the 9th I was at Rushworth. I have lately passed through some painful labour; but have been comforted under a sense of that Divine visitation, which I feel extended towards many young people.
   16th of 8th mo. and 1st of the week, I was at Settle. It hath of late been a time of inward poverty; under which my mind hath been preserved in a watchful tender state, feeling for the mind of the holy Leader, and I find peace in the
labours I have passed through. On inquiry in many places, I find the price of rye about five shillings; wheat eight shillings per bushel; oatmeal twelve shillings for a hundred and twenty pounds; mutton from three pence to five pence per pound; bacon from seven pence to nine pence; cheese from four pence to six pence; butter from eight pence to ten pence; house rent for a poor man, from twenty-five shillings to forty shillings per year, to be paid weekly; wood for fire very scarce and dear; coal in some places, two shillings and six
pence per hundred weight; but near the pits not a quarter so much. O may the wealthy consider the poor!
   The wages of labouring men, in several counties towards London, are ten pence per day in common business, the employer finds small beer, and the labourer finds his own food; but in harvest and hay time, wages are about one shilling per day, and the labourer hath all his diet. In some parts of the north of England, poor labouring men have their food where they work, and appear in common to do rather better than nearer London. Industrious women, who spin in the factories, get some four pence, some five pence, and so on to six,
seven, eight, nine, or ten pence per day, and find their own house-room and diet. Great numbers of poor people live chiefly on bread and water, in the southern parts of England, as well as in the northern parts; and there are many poor children not even taught to read. May those who have abundance lay these things to heart!
   Stage coaches frequently go upwards of one hundred miles in twenty-four hours; and I have heard friends say, in several places, that it is common for horses to be killed with hard driving, and that many others are driven till they grow blind.
   Post-boys pursue their business, each one to his stage, all night through the winter. Some boys, who ride long stages, suffer greatly in winter nights, and at several places, I have heard of their being frozen to death. So great is the
hurry in the spirit of this world, that in aiming to do business quickly, and to gain wealth, the creation at this day doth loudly groan.
   As my journey hath been without a horse, I have had several offers of being assisted on my way in these stage coaches, but have not been in them; nor have I had freedom to send letters by these posts, in the present way of their
riding; the stages being so fixed, and one boy dependent on another, as to time and going at great speed, that in long cold winter nights, the poor boys suffer much. I heard in America of the way of these posts; and cautioned friends in the general meeting of ministers and elders at Philadelphia, and in the yearly meeting of ministers and elders in London, not to send letters to me on any common occasion by post. And though, on this account, I may be likely not to hear so often from my family left behind; yet for righteousness sake I am, through Divine favour, made content.
   I have felt great distress of mind, since I came on this island, on account of the members of our society being mixed with the world in various sorts of traffic, carried on in impure channels. Great is the trade to Africa for slaves! And for the loading of these ships, a great number of people are employed in their factories; among whom are many of our society. Friends, in early times, refused on a religious principle, to make or trade in superfluities; of which we have many testimonies on record: but for want of faithfulness, some, whose examples were of note in our society, gave way; from which others took more liberty. Members of our society worked in superfluities, and bought and sold them; and thus dimness of sight came over many: at length, friends got into the use of some superfluities in dress, and in the furniture of their houses; which hath spread from less to more, till superfluity of some kinds is common among us.
   In this declining state, many look at the example of others and too much neglect the pure feeling of truth. Of late years, a deep exercise hath attended my mind, that friends may dig deep, may carefully cast forth the loose matter, and get down to the Rock, the sure foundation, and there hearken to that Divine voice which gives a clear and certain sound; and I have felt in that which doth not deceive, that if friends who have known the truth, keep in that tenderness of heart, where all views of outward gain are given up, and their trust is only in the Lord, he will graciously lead some to be patterns of deep self-denial in things relating to trade and handicraft labour: and. others who have plenty of the treasures of this world, will be examples of a plain frugal life, and pay wages to such as they may hire, more liberally than is now customary in some places.
   23rd of 8 mo. I was this day at Preston Patrick, and had a comfortable meeting. I have several times been entertained at the houses of friends, who had sundry things about them that had the appearance of outward greatness ; and as I have kept inward, way hath opened for conversation with such in
private, in which Divine goodness hath favoured us together with heart-tendering times.
   26th of 8 mo. � Being now at George Crosfield's, in the county of Westmoreland, I feel a concern to commit to writing, the following uncommon circumstance. In a time of sickness with the pleurisy, a little more than
two years and a half ago, I was brought so near the gates of death, that I forgot my name. Being then desirous to know who I was, I saw a mass of matter of a dull gloomy colour, between the south and the east; and was informed that this mass was human beings in as great misery as they could be, and live, and that I was mixed with them, and that henceforth I might not consider myself as a distinct or separate being. In this state I remained several hours. I then heard a soft melodious voice, more pure and harmonious than any I had heard with my ears before; I believed it was the voice of an angel, who spake to the other angels: the words were � "John Woolman is dead." I soon remembered that I was once John Woolman, and being assured that I was alive in the body, I greatly wondered what that heavenly voice could mean. I believed beyond doubting that it was the voice of an holy angel, but as yet it was a mystery to me.
   I was then carried in spirit to the mines, where poor oppressed people were digging rich treasures for those called Christians, and heard them blaspheme the name of Christ; at which I was grieved; for his name to me was precious.
I was then informed that these heathens were told, that those who oppressed them were the followers of Christ; and they said among themselves, "if Christ directed them to use us in this sort, then Christ is a cruel tyrant."
   All this time the song of the angel remained a mystery; and in the morning, my dear wife and some others coming to my bedside, I asked them if they knew who I was; and they telling me I was John Woolman, thought I was light-headed: for I told them not what the angel said, nor was I disposed to talk much to any one, but was very desirous to get so deep, that I might understand this mystery.
   My tongue was often so dry, that I could not speak till I had moved it about and gathered some moisture; and as I lay still for a time, I at length felt Divine power prepare my mouth that I could speak; and I then said, "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."
   Then the mystery was opened, and I perceived there was joy in heaven over a sinner who had repented; and that the language "John Woolman is dead," meant no more than the death of my own will. Soon after I coughed, and raised much bloody matter, which I had not done during this vision. My natural understanding now returned as before, and I saw that people
setting off their tables with silver vessels at entertainments, was often stained with worldly glory; and that in the present state of things, I should take heed how I fed myself out of such vessels. Going to our monthly meeting soon after
my recovery, I dined at a friend's house where drink was brought in silver vessels, and not in any other. Wanting something to drink, I told him my case with weeping, and he ordered some drink for me in another vessel. I afterwards went through the same exercise in several friends' houses in
America, as well as in England, and I have cause to acknowledge with humble reverence, the loving kindness of my heavenly Father, who hath preserved me in such a tender frame of mind, that none, I believe, have ever been offended
at what I have said on that subject.
   After this sickness, I spake not in public meetings for worship for nearly one year; but my mind was very often in company with the oppressed slaves, as I sat in meetings; and though, under this dispensation, I was shut up from speaking, yet the spring of the gospel ministry was, many times, livingly
opened in me, and the Divine gift operated by abundance of weeping, in feeling the oppression of this people. It being so long since I passed through this dispensation, and the matter remaining fresh and lively in my mind, I believe it safest for me to commit it to writing.
   I rested a few days, in body and mind, with our friend Jane Crosfield who was once in America. On the sixth day of the week I was at Kendal in Westmoreland; and at Greyrig meeting the thirtieth day of the month, and first of the week.
   I have known poverty of late, and have been graciously supported to keep in the patience : and am thankful, under a sense of the goodness of the Lord towards those who are of a contrite spirit.
   6th of 9 mo. and first of the week, I was this day at Counterside; a large meeting house, and very full. Through the opening of pure love, it was a strengthening time to me, and I believe to many more.
   13th of 6 mo. This day I was at Leyburn, a small meeting; but the town's people coming in, the house was crowded. It was a time of heavy labour, and I believe was a profitable meeting. At this place I heard that my kinsman William Hunt from North Carolina, who was on a religious visit to friends in England, departed this life on the 9th of this month, of the small pox, at Newcastle. He appeared in the ministry when a youth, and his labours therein were of good savour. He travelled much in that work in America. I once heard
him say in public testimony, that his concern in that visit was to be devoted to the service of Christ so fully, that he might not spend one minute in pleasing himself; which words joined with his example, was a means of stirring up the pure mind in me.
   Having of late often travelled in wet weather, through narrow streets in towns and villages, where dirtiness under foot, and the scent arising from that filth, which more or less infects the air of all thickly settled towns, were disagreeable; and being but weakly, 1 have felt distress both in body and
mind with that which is impure. In these journeys I have been where much cloth hath been dyed; and have at sundry times walked over ground where much of their dye-stuffs has drained away. This hath produced a longing in my
mind, that people might come into cleanness of spirit, cleanness of person, and cleanness about their houses and garments.
   Some of the great carry delicacy to a great height themselves, and yet real cleanliness is not generally promoted. Dyes being invented partly to please the eye, and partly to hide dirt, I have felt in this weak state, when travelling in
dirtiness, and affected with unwholesome scents, a strong desire that the*nature of dyeing cloth to hide dirt may be more fully considered.
Washing our garments to keep them sweet is cleanly, but it is the opposite to real cleanliness to hide dirt in them. Through giving way to hiding dirt in our garments, a spirit which would conceal that which is disagreeable is strengthened. Real cleanliness becometh a holy people; but hiding that which is not clean by colouring our garments, seems contrary to the sweetness of sincerity. Through some sorts of dyes cloth is rendered less useful. And if the value of dye stuffs, the expense of dyeing, and the damage done to cloth, were all added together, and that cost applied to keeping all sweet and clean, how much more would real cleanliness prevail.
   On this visit to England, I have felt some instructions sealed on my mind, which I am concerned to leave in writing, for the use of such as are called to the station of a minister of Christ. Christ being the Prince of peace, and we being no more . than ministers, it is necessary for us, not only to feel a concern in our first going forth, but to experience the renewing thereof, in the appointment of meetings. I felt a concern in America, to prepare for this voyage; and being through the mercy of God, brought safe hither, my heart was like a vest- sel that wanted vent. For several weeks after my arrival, when my mouth was opened in meetings, it was like the raising of a gate in a water-course, when a weight of water lay upon it. In these labours there was a fresh visitation to many, especially to the youth; but sometimes I felt poor and
empty, and yet there appeared a necessity to appoint meetings.
   In this I was exercised to abide in the pure life of truth, and in all my labours to watch diligently against the motions of self in my own mind. I have frequently found a necessity to stand up, when the spring of the ministry was low, and to speak from the necessity, in that which subjecteth the will of the creature; and herein I was united with the suffering seed, and found inward
sweetness in these mortifying labours. As I have been preserved in a watchful attention to the Divine leader, under these dispensations enlargement at times hath followed, and the power of truth hath risen higher in some meetings, than I ever knew it before through me. Thus I have been more and more instructed as to the necessity of depending, not upon a concern which I felt in America, to come on a visit to England, but upon the daily instructions of Christ, the Prince of peace.
   Of late I have sometimes felt a stop in the appointment of meetings, not wholly, but in part; and I do not feel liberty to appoint them so quickly one after another as I have done heretofore. The work of the ministry being a work of Divine love, I feel that the openings thereof are to be waited for in all our appointments. Oh how deep is Divine wisdom! Christ puts forth his ministers, and goeth before them; and oh how great is the danger of departing from the pure feeling of that which leadeth safely ! Christ knoweth the state of the people, and in the pure feeling of the gospel ministry, their states are opened to his servants. Christ knoweth when the fruit-bearing branches themselves have need of purging. Oh that these lessons may be remembered by me! and that all who appoint meetings may proceed in the pure feeling of duty!
I have sometimes felt a necessity to stand up, but that spirit which is of the world hath so much prevailed in many, and the pure life of truth hath been so pressed down, that I have gone forward, not as one travelling in a road cast up and well prepared, but as a man walking through a miry place, in which are stones here and there safe to step on, but so situated that one step being taken, time is necessary to see where to step next. No, I find that in a state of pure obedience, the mind learns contentment, in appearing weak and foolish to
that wisdom which is of the world; and in these lowly labours, they who stand in a low place, and are rightly exercised under the cross, will find nourishment. The gift is pure; and while the eye is single in attending thereto, the understanding is preserved clear; self is kept out. We rejoice in filling up that which remains of the afflictions of Christ, for his body's sake, which is the church.
   The natural man loveth eloquence, and many love to hear eloquent orations; and if there be not a careful attention to the gift, men who have once laboured in the pure gospel ministry, growing weary of suffering, and ashamed of appearing weak, may kindle a fire, compass themselves about with sparks, and walk in the light; not of Christ who is under suffering, but of that fire which they in departing from the gift, have kindled, in order that those hearers, who have left the meek, suffering state for. worldly wisdom, may be warmed with this fire, and speak highly of their labours. That which is of God gathers to God; and that which is of the world, is owned by the world.
   In this journey a labour hath attended my mind, that the ministers among us may be preserved in the meek, feeling life of truth, where we may have no desire but to follow Christ, and to be with him; that when he is under suffering, we may suffer with him; and never desire to rise up in dominion, but as he, by the virtue of his own spirit, may raise us.
   A few days after writing these considerations, our dear friend, in the course of his religious visits, came to the city of York, and attended most of the sittings of the quarterly meeting there; but before it was over, he was taken ill of the small-pox. Our friend Thomas Priestman, and others who attended him, preserved the following minutes of his expressions in the time of his sickness, and of his decease.
   First day, the 27th of the ninth month, 1772. � His disorder appeared to be the small-pox. Being asked to have a doctor's advice, he signified he had not freedom or liberty in his mind so to do, standing wholly resigned to His will, who gave him life, and whose power he had witnessed to raise and heal him in sickness before, when he seemed nigh unto death; and if he was to wind up now, he was perfectly resigned, having no will either to live or die, and did not choose any should be sent for to him: but a young man, an apothecary, coming of his own accord the next day, and desiring to do something for him, he said he found a freedom to confer with him and the other friends about him, and if any thing should be proposed as to medicine, that did not come through defiled channels or oppressive hands, he should be willing to consider and take it, so far as he found freedom. 
   Second day. � He said he felt the disorder to affect his head, so that he could think little, and but as a child; and desired, if his understanding should be more affected, to have nothing given him that those about him knew he had a testimony against.
