EFFECT OF THE REVENUE INVESTMENT ON THE COMPANY
HITHERTO, Your Committee has considered this system of Revenue Investment, substituted in the place of a commercial link between India and Europe, so far as it affects India only: they are now to consider it as it affects the Company. So long as that Corporation continued to receive a vast quantity of merchantable goods, without any disbursement for the purchase, so long it possessed wherewithal to continue a Dividend, to pay debts, and to contribute to the State. But it must have been always evident to considerate persons, that this vast extraction oi wealth from a country, lessening in its resources in proportion to the increase of its burthens, was not calculated for a very long duration. For a while, the Company's Servants kept up this Investment, not by improving commerce, manufacture, or agriculture, but by forcibly raising the Land Rents on the principles and in the manner hereafter to be described. When these extortions disappointed, or threatened to disappoint, expectation, in order to purvey for the avarice, which raged in England, they fought for expedients in breaches of all the agreements, by which they were bound by any payment to the Country Powers, and in exciting disturbances among all the neighbouring Princes. Stimulating their ambition, and fomenting their mutual animosities, they fold to them reciprocally their common servitude and ruin.
Indeed, the Investment has not been for any long time the natural product of the Revenue of Bengal: when by the vast charge, and by the ill return of an evil political and military traffick, and by a prodigal increase of establishments, and a profuse conduct in distributing agencies and contracts, they found themselves under difficulties, instead, of being cured of their immoral and impolitick delusion, they plunged deeper into ir, and were drawn from expedient to expedient for the supply of the Investment, into that endless�chain of wars, which this House, by its resolutions, has so justly condemned. At home these measures were sometimes countenanced, sometimes winked at, sometimes censured, but always with an acceptance of whatever profit they afforded.
  At length the funds for the Investment, and for these wars together, could no longer be supplied. In the year 1778, the provision for the Investment from the revenues, and from the monopolies, stood very high. It was estimated at a million four hundred thousand pounds; and of this it appears that a great deal was realized. But this was the high flood tide of the Investment; for in that year they announce its probable decline; and that such extensive supplies could not be continued. The advances to the Board of Trade became less punctual, and many disputes arose about the time of making them. However, knowing that all their credit at home depended on the Investment, or upon an opinion of its magnitude, whilst they repeat their warning of a probable deficiency, and that their "Finances bore an unfavourable aspect," in the year 1779, they rate the Investment still higher. stut their payments becoming less and less regular, and the war carrying away all the supplies, at length Mr. Hastings, in December 1780, denounced sentence of approaching dissolution to this system, and tells the Directors that " He bore too high a respect for their�v�characters, to treat them with the management of a piepara"tory and gradual introduction to an unplealing report. 
  He was not mistaken in his prognostick. Loans now becoming the regular resource for retrieving the Investment, whose ruin was inevitable, the Council enable the Board of Trade, in April 1781, to grant certificates for Government Bonds at eight per-cent. Interest for about��650,000. The Investment was fixed at��900,000.
  But now another alarming system appeared. These new bonds overloaded the market: those, which had been formerly issued, were at a discount; the Board of Trade was obliged to advance, therefore, a fourth more than usual to the Contractors. This seemed to satisfy that description of dealers. But as those, who bought on agency, were limited to no terms of mutual advantage; and the bonds on the new issue falling from three to eight, nine, and ten per cent, discount, the agents were unable to furnish at the usual prices. Accordingly a discount was settled on such terms as could be made; the lowest discount, and that at two places only, was at four per cent; which, with the interest on the bonds, made (besides the earlier advance) at the least twelve per cent, additional charge upon all goods. It was evident, that as the Investment, instead of being supported by the Revenues, was sunk by the fall of their credit; so the net Revenues were diminished by the daily accumulation of an interest accruing on account of the Investment. What was done to alleviate one complaint thus aggravating the other, and at length proving pernicious to both, this trade on bonds likewise came to its period.
Your Committee has reason to think, that the bonds have since that time sunk to a discount much greater even than what is now stated. 
  By this failure, a total revolution ensued of the most extraordinary nature, and to which Your Committee wish to call the particular attention of the House. For the Council General, in their letter of the 8th of April 1782, aster stating that they were disappointed in their expectations (how grounded it does not appear. 
  It is impossible, in reporting this revolution to the House, to avoid remarking with what fidelity Mr. Hastings and his Council have adhered to the mode of transmitting their accounts, which Your Committee found it necessary to mark and censure in their First Report. Its pernicious tendency is there fully set forth. They were peculiarly called on for a most accurate state of their affairs, in order to explain the necessity of having recourse to such a scheme, as well as for a full and correct account of the scheme itself. But they send only the above short Minute by one dispatch over land, whilst the copy of the plan itself, on which the Directors must form their judgment, is lent separately in another dispatch over land, which has never arrived. A third dispatch, which also contained the plan, was sent by a tea conveyance, and arrived late. The Directors have, for very obvious reasons, ordered, by a strict injunction, that they should send�Duplicates�of�all�their dispatches by�every�ship.�The spirit of this rule perhaps ought to extend to every mode of conveyance. In this cafe, so far from sending a duplicate, they do not send even one perfect account. They announce a plan by one conveyance, and they send it by another conveyance, with other delays and other risks.
At length, at nearly four months distance, the plan has been received; and appears to be substantially that, which had been announced, but developing in the particulars many new circumstances of the greatest importance. By this plan it appears, that the subscription, even in idea or pretence, is not for the use of the Company; but that the subscribers are united into a fort of society for the remitting their�privatefortunes:�the goods indeed are said to�he�flipped�on�the�Company's�account,�and they are directed to be sold on the same account, and at the usual periods of sale. For the management of this concern in Bengal they choose commissioners by their own authority. By the same authority they form them into a body; they put them under rules and regulations; and they empower them also to make regulations of their own. They remit by the like authority the duties, to which all private trade is subject, and they charge the whole concern with seven�per�cent,�to be paid from the net produce of the- sales in England, as a rccompcncc to the Commissioners; for this the Commissioners contract to bear all the charges�on�the goods to the time of shipping.
The servants having formed this plan of trade, and a new com million for the conduct of it, on their private account, �  it is a matter of consideration, to know who the Commissioners are. They turn out to be the three senior servants of the Company's Board of Trade, who choose to take upon them to be the factors of others, for large emoluments, whilst they receive salaries of two thousand pounds and fifteen hundred pounds a year from the Company. As the Company have no other fund than the new Investment, from whence they are to be paid for the care of their servants property, this commission and those salaries being to take place of their brokerage, they in effect render it very difficult, if not impossible, for them to derive advantage from their new occupation.
  As to the benefit of�this�plan:�besides preventing the loss, which must happen from the Company's ships returning empty to Europe, and the slopping of all trade between India and England, the authors of it state. As to the combination of this mode of remittance with the Company's Investment, nothing can be affirmed concerning it until some satisfactory assurance can be held out, that such an Investment can ever be realized. Mr. Hastings, and the Gentlemen of the Council, have not afforded any ground for such an expectation. That the Indian trade may become a permanent vehicle of the private fortunes of the Company's servants is very probable; that is, as permanent as the means of acquiring fortunes in India; but that�some�profit�will accrue to the Company is absolutely impossible. The Company are to bear all the charge outwards, and a very great part of that homewards; and their only compensation is the surplus commission on the sale of other people's goods. The nation will undoubtedly avoid great loss and detriment, which would be the inevitable consequence of the total cessation of the trade with Bengal, and the ships returning without cargoes. But if this temporary expedient should be improved into a system, no occasional advantages to be derived from it would be sufficient to balance the mischiefs of finding a great parliamentary corporation turned into a vehicle for remitting to England the private fortunes of those, for whose benefit the territorial possessions in India are, in effect and substance, under this project, to be�solely�held.
  By this extraordinary scheme, the Company is totally overturned, and all its relations inverted. From being a body concerned in trade on their own account, and employing their servants as factors, the servants have at one stroke taken the whole trade into their own hands, on their own capital of �800,000, at their own risk; and the Company are become agents and factors to them, to fell by commission�their�goods for�their�profit.
  To enable Your Committee to form some judgment upon the profit, which may accrue to the Company from its new relation and employment, they directed, that an Estimate should be made of the probable proceeds of an Investment conducted on�the principles of that intended to be realized for 1783. By this Estimate, which is subjoined, it appears to Your Committee, that so far from any surplus profit from this transaction, the Bengal adventurers themselves, instead of realizing 2s�2d, the Rupee (the standard they fix for their payment), will not receive the 1s�9d�which is its utmost value in silver at the Mint; nor probably above 1s�5d�With this certain lots before their eyes, it is impossible that they can ever complete their subscription, unless, by management among themselves, they should be able to procure the goods for their own account upon other terms than those, on which they purchased them for their masters, or unless they have for the supply of the Company, on their hands, a quantity of goods, which they cannot otherwise dispose of. This latter cafe is not very improbable, from their proposing to fend ten sixteenths of the whole Investment in silk: which, as will be seen hereafter, the Company has prohibited to be sent on their account, as a disadvantageous article. Nothing, but the servants being overloaded, can rationally account for their choice of so great a proportion of so dubious a commodity.
  On the state made by two Reports of a Committee of the General Court in 1782, their affairs were even then reduced to a low ebb. But under the arrangement announced by Mr. Hastings and his colleagues, it does not appear, after this period of the servants investment, from what fund the proprietors are to make any dividend at all. The objects of the sale, from whence the dividend is to arise, are not�their�goods: they stand accountable to others for the whole probable produce. The state of the Company's commerce will therefore become an object of serious consideration ; an affair, as Your Committee apprehends, of as much difficulty as ever tried the faculties of this House. For on the one hand it is plain, that the system of providing the Company's import into Europe, resting almost wholly on an Investment from its territorial Revenues, has failed: during its continuance it was supported on principles fatal to the prosperity of that country. On the other hand, if the nominal commerce of the Company is suffered to be carried on for the account of the servants abroad, by investing the emoluments made in their stations, these emoluments are therefore inclusively authorized, and with them the practices, from�which they accrue. All parliamentary attempts to reform this system will be contradictory to its institution. If, for instance, five hundred thousand pounds sterling annually be necessary for this kind of Investment, any regulation, which may�prevent the acquisition of that sum, operates against the Investment, which is the end proposed by the plan.
  On this new scheme, (which is neither calculated for a future security, nor for a present relief to the Company,) it is not visible in what manner the settlements in India can be at all upheld. The gentlemen in employments abroad call for the whole produce of the year's Investment from Bengal; but for the payment of the counter-investment from Europe, which is for the far greater part sent out for the support of their power, no provision at all is made: they have not, it seems, agreed that it should be charged to their account, or that any deduction should be made for it from the produce of their sales in Leadenhall-street. How far such a scheme is preferable to the total suspension of trade, Your Committee cannot positively determine. In all likelihood extraordinary expedients were necessary; but the causes, which induced this necessity, ought to be more fully enquired into; for the last step in a series of conduct may be justifiable upon principles, that suppose great blame in those, which preceded it.
  After Your Committee had made the foregoing observations upon the plan of Mr. Hastings and his colleagues transmitted to the Court of Directors, an extract of the Madras Consultations was a few days ago laid before us. This extract contains a letter from the Governour General and Council of Bengal to the Presidency of Fort Saint George, which affords a very striking, though to Your Committee by no means an unexpected, picture of the instability of their opinions and conduct. On the 8th of April the servants had regularly formed and digested the above-mentioned plan, which was to form the basis for the investment of their own�fortunes, and to furnish the sole means of the commercial existence of their masters. 
The plan of April divests the Company of all property in Bengal goods transported to Europe; but in recompence they are freed from all the risk and expense; they are not loaded with interest; and they are not embarrassed with bills. The plan of May reinstates them in their old relation; but in return their revenues in Bengal are charged with an interest of 8 per cent. on the sum subscribed, until bills shall be drawn. They are made proprietors of cargoes, purchased under the disadvantage of that interest at their own hazard. They are subjected to all losses; and they are involved in Europe for payments of bills to the amount of eighty lacks of rupees, at two shillings the rupee, that is, in bills for eight hundred thousand pounds sterling. It is probably on account of the previous interest of 8 per cent that the value of the rupee on this scheme is reduced. Mr. Hastings and his colleagues announce to Lord Macartney no other than the foregoing alteration in their plan.
It is discouraging to attempt any sort of observation on plans thus shifting their principle, whilst their merits are under examination. The judgment formed on the scheme of April has nothing to do with the project of May. Tour committee has not suppressed any part of the reflections, which occurred to them, on the former of these plans; first, because the Company knows of no other by any regular transmissions; secondly, because it is by no means certain, that before the expiration of June the governor-general and council may not revert to the plan of April. They speak of that plan as likely to be (or make a part of one that shall be)�permanent.�Many reasons are alleged by its authors in its favour, grounded on the state of their affairs; none whatever are assigned for the alteration. It is indeed morally certain, that persons, who had money to remit, must have made the same calculation which has been made by the directions of your committee, and the result must have been equally clear to them; which is, that instead of realizing two shillings and twopence the rupee on their subscription, as they proposed, they could never hope to see more than one shilling and ninepence. This calculation probably shook the main pillar of the project of April. But on the other hand, as the subscribers to the second scheme can have no certain assurance, that the Company will accept bills so far exceeding their allowance in this particular, the necessity of remitting their fortunes may beat them back to their old ground. The Danish Company was the only means of remitting which remained. Attempts have been made with success to revive a Portuguese trade for that purpose. It is by no means clear, whether Mr. Hastings and his colleagues will adhere to either of the foregoing plans; or indeed, whether any investment at all to that amount can be realized; because nothing but the convenience of remitting the gains of British subjects to London can support any of these projects. The situation of the Company under this perpetual variation in the system of their investment is truly perplexing. The manner, in which they arrive at any knowledge of it, is no less so. The letter to Lord Macartney, by which the variation is discovered, was not intended for transmission to the directors. It was merely for the information of those who were admitted to a share of the subscription at Madras. When Mr. Hastings sent this information to those subscribers, he might well enough have presumed an event to happen, which did happen, that is, that a vessel might be despatched from Madras to Europe; and indeed by that, and by every devisable means, he ought not only to have apprized the directors of this most material change in the plan of the investment, but to have entered fully into the grounds and reasons of his making it.
  It appears to your committee, that the ships, which brought to England the plan of the 8th of April, did not sail from Bengal until the 1st of May. If the change had been in contemplation for any time before the 13th of April, two days would have sufficed to send an account of it, and it might have arrived along with the plan, which it affected. If therefore such a change was in agitation before the sailing of the ships, and yet was concealed when it might have been communicated, the concealment is censurable. It is not improbable, that some change of the kind was made, or meditated, before the sailing of the ships for Europe; for it is hardly to be imagined, that reasons, wholly unlooked for, should appear for setting aside a plan, concerning the success of which the council-general seemed so very confident; that a new one should be proposed; that its merits should be discussed among the monied men; that it should be adopted in council, and officially ready for transmission to Madras, in twelve or thirteen days. In this perplexity of plan and of transmission, the court of directors may have made an arrangement of their affairs on the ground-work of the first scheme, which was officially and authentically conveyed to them. The fundamental alteration of that plan in India might require another of a very different kind in England; which the arrangements taken in consequence of the first might make it difficult, if not impossible, to execute. What must add to the confusion is, that the alteration has not the regular and official authority of the original plan, and may be presumed to indicate with certainty nothing more than that the business is�again�afloat, and that no scheme is finally determined on. Thus the Company is left without any fixed data, upon which they can make a rational disposition of their affairs.
The fact is, that the principles and economy of the Company's trade have been so completely corrupted by turning it into a vehicle for tribute, that, whenever circumstances require it to be replaced again upon a bottom truly commercial, hardly anything but confusion and disasters can be expected as the first results. Even before the acquisition of the territorial revenues, the system of the Company's commerce was not formed upon principles the most favourable to its prosperity: for whilst, on the one hand, that body received encouragement by royal and parliamentary charters, was invested with several ample privileges, and even with a delegation of the most essential prerogatives of the crown; on the other, its commerce was watched with an invidious jealousy, as a species of dealing dangerous to the national interests. In that light, with regard to the Company's imports, there was a total prohibition from domestic use of the most considerable articles of their trade; that is, of all silk stuffs, and stained and painted cottons. The British market was in a great measure interdicted to the British trader. Whatever advantages might arise to the general trading interests of the kingdom by this restraint, its East-India interest was undoubtedly injured by it. The Company is also, and has been from a very early period, obliged to furnish the ordnance with a quantity of saltpetre at a certain price, without any reference to the standard of the markets either of purchase or of sale. With regard to their export, they were put also under difficulties upon very mistaken notions; for they were obliged to export annually a certain proportion of British manufactures, even though they should find for them in India none or but an unprofitable want. This compulsory export might operate, and in some instances has operated, in a manner more grievous than a tax to the amount of the loss in trade. For the payment of a tax is in general divided in unequal portions between the vender and consumer, the largest part falling upon the latter. In the case before us the tax may be as a dead charge on the trading capital of the Company.
The spirit of all these regulations naturally tended to weaken, in the very original constitution of the Company, the main-spring of the commercial machine,�the�principles�of�profit�and�loss.�And the mischief arising from an inattention to those principles has constantly increased with the increase of its power. For when the Company had acquired the rights of sovereignty in India, it was not to be expected, that the attention to profit and loss would have increased. The idea of remitting tribute in goods naturally produced an indifference to their price and quality; the goods themselves appearing little else than a sort of package to the tribute. Merchandise taken as tribute, or bought in lieu of it, can never long be of a kind, or of a price, fitted to a market, which stands solely on its commercial reputation. The indifference of the mercantile sovereign to his trading advantages naturally relaxed the diligence of his subordinate factor-magistrates through all their gradations and in all their functions; it gave rise, at least so far as the principal was concerned, to much neglect of price and of goodness in their purchases. If ever they showed any extraordinary degrees of accuracy and selection, it would naturally be in favour of that interest, to which they could not be indifferent. The Company might suffer above, the natives might suffer below; the intermediate party must profit to the prejudice of both.
Your committee are of opinion, that the Company is now arrived at that point, when the investment from surplus revenue, or from the spoil of war, ceasing, it is become much more necessary to fix its commerce upon a commercial basis. And this opinion led your committee to a detailed review of all the articles of the Indian traffic, upon which the profit and loss was steady; and we have chosen a period of four years, during the continuance of the revenue investment, and prior to any borrowing, or any extraordinary drawing of bills, in order to find out how far the trade, under circumstances when it will be necessary to carry it on by borrowing, or by bills, or by exportation of bullion, can be sustained in the former course, so as to secure the capital, and to afford a reasonable dividend. And your committee find, that in the first four years the investment from Bengal amounted to �4,176,525; upon �2,260,277, there was a gain of �186,377; and, upon �1,916,248, a loss of �705,566: so that the excess of loss above gain� upon the whole of the foregoing capital, was in the four years no less than �519,229.
  If the trade were confined to Bengal, and the Company were to trade on those terms upon a capital borrowed at 8 per cent. Indian interest, their revenues in that province would be soon so overpowered with debt, that those revenues, instead of supporting the trade, would be totally destroyed by it. If, on the other hand, the Company traded upon bills with every advantage, far from being in a condition to divide the smallest per centage, their bankruptcy here would be inevitable.
Your committee then turned to the trade of the other factories and presidencies, and they constantly found, that as the power and dominion of the Company was less, their profit on the goods was greater. The investments of Madras, Bombay, and Bencoolen have, in the foregoing four years, upon a capital of �1,151,176, had a gain upon the whole of �329,622. The greatest of all is that of Bencoolen, which, on a capital of �76,571, produced a profit of �107,760. This however is but a small branch of the Company's trade. The trade to China, on a capital of �1,717,463, produced an excess of gain, amounting to �874,096, which is about 50 per cent. But such was the evil influence of the Bengal investment, that not only the profits of the Chinese trade, but of all the lucrative branches taken together, were so sunk .and ingulfed in it, that the whole profit on a capital of �7,045,164, reached to no more than �684,489; that is, to �189,607 less than the profit on the Chinese trade alone: less than the total profits on the gainful trades taken together, �520,727.
  It is very remarkable, that in the year 1778, when the Bengal investment stood at the highest, that is, so high as �1,223,316, though the Chinese trade produced an excess of gain in that year of �209,243, and that no loss of moment could be added to that of Bengal, (except about �45,000, on the Bombay trade,) the whole profit of a capital of �2,040,787, amounted only to the sum of �9,480.
The circumstances of the time have rendered it necessary to call up a vigorous attention to this state of the trade of the Company between Europe and India.

INTERNAL TRADE OF BENGAL
THE�internal trade of Bengal has next attracted the inquiries of your committee.
The great and valuable articles of the Company's investment, drawn from the articles of internal trade, are raw silk, and various descriptions of piece-goods made of silk and cotton. These articles are not under any formal monopoly; nor does the Company at present exercise a�declared�right of preemption with regard to them. But it does not appear that the trade in these particulars is or can be perfectly free; not so much on account of any direct measures taken to prevent it, as from the circumstances of the country, and the manner of carrying on business there. For the present trade, even in these articles, is built from the ruins of old monopolies, and pre-emptions, and necessarily partakes of the nature of its materials.
  In order to show in what manner manufactures and trade so constituted contribute to the prosperity of the natives, your committee conceives it proper to take, in this place, a short general view of the progress of the English policy with relation to the commerce of Bengal, and the several stages and gradations, by which it has been brought into its actual state. The modes of abuse, and the means, by which commerce has suffered, will be considered in greater detail under the distinct heads of those objects which have chiefly suffered by them.
  During the time of the Mogul government, the princes of that race, who omitted nothing for the encouragement of commerce in their dominions, bestowed very large privileges and immunities on the English East-India Company, exempting them from several duties, to which their natural-born subjects were liable. The Company's dustuck, or passport, secured to them this exemption at all the custom-houses and toll-bars of the country. The Company not being able, or not choosing, to make use of their privilege to the full extent to which it might be carried, indulged their servants with a qualified use of their passport, under which, and in the name of the Company, they carried on a private trade, either by themselves, or in society with natives; and thus found a compensation for the scanty allowances made to them by their masters in England. As the country government was at that time in the fulness of its strength, and that this immunity existed by a double connivance, it was naturally kept within tolerable limits.
But by the revolution in 1757, the Company's servants obtained a mighty ascendant over the native princes of Bengal, who owed their elevation to the British arms. The Company, which was new to that kind of power, and not yet thoroughly apprized of its real character and situation, considered itself still as a trader in the territories of a foreign potentate, in the prosperity of whose country it had neither interest nor duty. The servants, with the same ideas, followed their fortune in the channels in which it had hitherto ran, only enlarging them�with the enlargement of their power. For their first ideas of profit were not official; nor were their oppressions those of ordinary despotism. The first instruments of their power were formed out of evasions of their ancient subjection. The passport of the Company in the hands of its servants was no longer under any restraint; and in a very short time their immunity began to cover all the merchandise of the country. Cossim Ali Khan, the second of the Nabobs whom they had set up, was but ill disposed to the instruments of his greatness. He bore the yoke of this imperious commerce with the utmost impatience: he saw his subjects excluded as aliens from their own trade, and the revenues of the prince overwhelmed in- the ruin of the commerce of his dominions. Finding his reiterated remonstrances on the extent and abuse of the passport ineffectual, he had recourse to an unexpected expedient, which was to declare his resolution at once to annul all the duties on trade, setting it equally free to subjects and to foreigners.
Never was a method of defeating the oppressions of monopoly more forcible, more simple, or more equitable: no sort of plausible objection could be made; and it was in vain to think of evading it. It was therefore met with the confidence of avowed and determined injustice. The presidency of Calcutta openly denied to the prince the power of protecting the trade of his subjects by the remission of his own duties. It was evident, that his authority drew to its period; many reasons and motives concurred, and his fall was hastened by the odium of the oppressions which he exercised voluntarily, as well as of those to which he was obliged to submit.
When this example was made, Jaffier Ali Khan, who had been deposed to make room for the last actor, was brought from penury and exile to a station, the terms of which he could not misunderstand. During his life, and in the time of his children, who succeeded to him, parts of the territorial revenue were assigned to the Company; and the whole, under the name of residency at the Nabob's court, was brought, directly or indirectly, under the control of British subjects. The Company's servants, armed with authorities delegated from the nominal government, or attended with, what was a stronger guard, the fame of their own power, appeared as magistrates in the markets, in which they dealt as traders.�It was impossible for the natives in general to distinguish, in the proceedings of the same persons, what was transacted on the Company's account from what was done on their own; and it will ever be so difficult to draw this line of distinction, that, as long as the Company does, directly or indirectly, aim at any advantage to itself in the purchase of any commodity whatever, so long will it be impracticable to prevent the servants availing themselves of the same privileges.
The servants, therefore, for themselves, or for their employers, monopolized every article of trade, foreign and domestic; not only the raw merchantable commodities, but the manufactures; and not only these, but the necessaries of life, or what in these countries habit has confounded with them; not only silk, cotton, piece-goods, opium, saltpetre, but not unfrequently salt, tobacco, betel nut, and the grain of most ordinary consumption. In the name of the country government they laid on or took off, and at their pleasure heightened or lowered, all duties upon goods: the whole trade of the country was either destroyed, or in shackles. The acquisition of the Duanne, in 1765, bringing the English into the immediate government of the country in its most essential branches, extended and confirmed all the former means of monopoly.
  In the progress of these ruinous measures, through all their details, innumerable grievances were suffered by the native inhabitants, which were represented in the strongest, that is, their true colours in England. Whilst the far greater part of the British in India were in eager pursuit of the forced and exorbitant gains of a trade carried on by power, contests naturally arose among the competitors: those who were overpowered by their rivals, became loud in their complaints to the court of directors, and were very capable, from experience, of pointing out every mode of abuse.
The court of directors, on their part, began, though very slowly, to perceive, that the country, which was ravaged by this sort of commerce, was their own. These complaints obliged the directors to a strict examination into the real sources of the mismanagement of their concerns in India, and to lay the foundations of a system of restraint on the exorbitancies of their servants. Accordingly, so early as the year 1765, they confine them to a trade only in articles of�export and import; and strictly prohibit them from all dealing in objects of internal consumption. About the same time, the presidency of Calcutta found it necessary to put a restraint upon themselves, or at least to make a show of a disposition (with which the directors appear much satisfied) to keep their own enormous power within bounds.
But, whatever might have been the intentions either of the directors or the presidency, both found themselves unequal to the execution of a plan, which went to defeat the projects of almost all the English in India; possibly comprehending some, who were makers of the regulations. For as the complaint of the country, or as their own interest, predominated with the presidency, they were always shifting from one course to the other; so that it became as impossible for the natives to know upon what principle to ground any commercial speculation, from the uncertainty of the law, under which they acted, as it was when they were oppressed by power without any colour of law at all; for the directors, in a few months after they had given these tokens of approbation to the above regulations in favour of the country-trade, tell the presidency.
Pressed in this urgent manner, the directors came more specifically to the grievance, and at once annul all the passports, with which their servants traded without duties, holding out means of compensation, of which it does not appear that any advantage was taken. In order that the duties which existed should no longer continue to burthen the trade either of the servants or natives, they ordered, that a number of oppressive toll-bars should be taken away, and the whole number reduced to nine of the most considerable.
When Lord Olive was sent to Bengal to effect a reformation of the many abuses which prevailed there, he considered monopoly to be so inveterate and deeply rooted, and the just rewards of the Company's servants to be so complicated with that injustice to the country, that the latter could not�easily be removed without taking away the former. He adopted therefore a plan for dealing in certain articles, which, as he conceived, rather ought to be called " a regulated and restricted trade" than a formal monopoly. By this plan he intended, that the profits should be distributed in an orderly and proportioned manner for the reward of services, and not seized by each individual according to the measure of his boldness, dexterity, or influence.
But this scheme of monopoly did not subsist long, at least in that mode, and for those purposes; three of the grand monopolies, those of opium, salt, and saltpetre, were successively by the Company taken into their own hands. The produce of the sale of the two former articles was applied to the purchase of goods for their investment; the latter was exported in kind for their sales in Europe. The senior servants had a certain share of emolument allotted to them from a commission on the revenues. The junior servants were rigorously confined to salaries, on which they were unable to subsist according to their rank. They were strictly ordered to abstain from all dealing in objects of internal commerce. Those of export and import were left open to young men without mercantile experience, and wholly unprovided with mercantile capitals; but abundantly furnished with large trusts of the public money, and with all the powers of an absolute government. In this situation, a religious abstinence from all illicit gain was prescribed to men at nine thousand miles distance from the seat of the supreme authority.
  Your committee is far from meaning to justify, or even to excuse, the oppressions and cruelties used by many in supplying the deficiencies of their regular allowances by all manner of extortion. But many smaller irregularities may admit some alleviation from thence. Nor does your committee mean to express any desire of reverting to the mode (contrived in India, but condemned by the directors) of rewarding the servants of a higher class by a regulated monopoly. Their object is to point out the deficiencies in the system, by which restrictions were laid, that could have little or no effect whilst want and power were suffered to be united.
But the proceedings of the directors at that time, though not altogether judicious, were in many respects honourable to them, and favourable, in the intention at least, to the country they governed. For finding their trading capital employed against themselves and against the natives, and struggling in vain against abuses, which were inseparably connected with the system of their own preference in trade, in the year 1773 they came to the manly resolution of setting an example to their servants, and gave up all use of power and influence in 'the two grand articles of their investment, silk and piece-goods. They directed that the articles should be bought at an equal and public market from the native merchants; and this order they directed to be published in all the principal marts of Bengal.
  Your committee are clearly of opinion, that no better method of purchase could be adopted. But it soon appeared that in deep.-rooted and inveterate abuses the wisest principles of reform may be made to operate so destructively, as wholly to discredit the design, and to dishearten all persons from the prosecution of it. The presidency, who seemed to yield with the utmost reluctance to the execution of these orders, soon made the directors feel their evil influence upon their own investment. For they found the silk and cotton cloths rose 25 per cent above theft former price, and a further rise of 40 per cent was announced to them.
