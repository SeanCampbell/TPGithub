ON THE AFFAIRS OF THE UNITED STATES
Tusculum, near Princeton, March 20, 1780
Dear Sir,
I received a letter from you, dated June 11, 1778, a few days after I had written to you a long letter of the date September 21, that year. The design that was to desire me to inquire after, and endeavor to procure the enlargement of one Alexander Muirhead, supposed to be carried into Boston. I immediately wrote to Boston myself, and cause one of the delegates of that state also to write; but we could hear nothing of him, so that probably was not carried into that place.
Your favor of March 19, 1779, acknowledging the receipt of mine of the 21st of September preceding, I received in the month of August last year. I am to blame and not answering it sooner; but I had no inclination to send an open letter through the English posts, and any proper opportunity of sending it another way seldom occurs. This goes by a gentleman who means to get to Europe upon business, and has promised to take particular care of it; so that I mean to embrace the opportunity of writing to you and some other of my friends. I am obliged you for your particular private home news about Glasgow, and would be glad of the continuance of such intelligence, and the more so, if you would take in Paisley also.
I have been, since I wrote you last, in general in good health, and indeed am at present in better health than I have been since I had the last fit. Accepting these fits, and the weakness that followed upon them, my health has been good ever since I came to America; and that weakness has been chiefly a swimming in my head, and fear and uncertainty when I went to make a long discourse in public. It was the opinion of Dr. Rush, that these fits were something of an apoplectic kind. It is remarkable that for these 12 months past I have had almost constantly the succession of pimples, or rather small files or blotches, about the temples, within the hair, and sometimes on the forehead; since which time I have been sensibly better and freer from the other complaint.
I have now left congress, not being able to support the expense of attending it, with the frequent journeys to Princeton, and being determined to give particular attention to the revival of the college. Professor Houston, however, are professor of mathematics, is a delegate this year; but he tells me he will certainly leave it next November. I mention this circumstance to confirm what I believe I wrote you formally, that the members of congress in general, not only received no profit from that office, but I believe 5/6 of them, if not more, are great loosers in their private affairs. This cannot be otherwise; for it is none of the delegates are allowed to have any lucrative office whatever, either in their own state or for the United States, though their expenses should be fully borne, their time is taken up, and their own private estates are neglected. At the end of the year 1778, gave notice to our legislature that they must either not chuse me at all, or leave me at full liberty to attend only one I could conveniently. They chose me however, and I made a good deal of use of that liberty in the year 1779; and this year all the delegates were changed 01, who had only been in one year, and who has not a house to go home to, his estate being in the neighborhood of New-York.
My family are well so far as I know. The trustees of the college have last September chose my son-in-law, Mr. Smith, Prof. of moral philosophy. He came to Princeton with his family in December. To him I gave up my house at college, and devolved upon him the whole business of boarding young gentleman, and retire to my house in the country, at the distance of one mile, and in full sight of Princeton. This I�ve had in view for some years, and intend to spend the remainder of my life, if possible, in otio cum dignatate. You know I was always fond of being a scientific farmer. That this position has not lost but gathered strength, since my being in America. In this respect I got a dreadful stroke indeed from the English when they were here, they having seized and mostly destroyed my whole stock, and committed such ravages that we are not yet fully recovered from it. My (now) eldest son sailed in October last for France, with Mr. Girard and Mr. Jay, late president of congress. He is to purchase a few medicines and instruments in Europe, and return to prosecute his business as a physician. My other son was studying law; but for the meanwhile, is private secretary to the present president of Congress, and my youngest daughter is at home.
As to public affairs it seems to be yet uncertain whether we shall have peace soon. Greatly do I and many others in America desire it; and yet, where our condition ten times worse than it is, nothing short of the clear independence of his country would be accepted. I observe, by your letter of 19th of March last year, that you had a high opinion of your successes at St. Lucia, in Georgia, and against the French trade. I believe before the end of the campaign, there was little reason to boast of your success upon the whole. I mentioned to you in my last how obstinately the court of England continued in erroneous opinions respecting America; and now I think that obstinacy has become incurable. It is plain that they still harp upon the same string, that a few leading men in congress stir up the people, and persuade them to continue the contest. Allow me to assure you that this is one of the most absurd and groundless opinions that ever was formed. The congress is changing every day. There is no instance in the whole contest, in which the public opinion did not go before their resolutions. To go back to the very beginning � the declaration of independence was forced upon the majority of the then congress, by the people in general; and, in consequence of subsequent elections, every six months that I have been in Congress has weakened the party that was suspected of coldness upon the subject; and now perhaps I may say it is annihilated.
I have read lately your parliamentary inquiry into the causes of your want of success in America. The examination of Galloway in particular is a curiosity. I know that he, and such as he, are blinded and stupified to an almost incredible degree, by their prejudices; and yet it is hard to suppose that he thought as he said in all points. For example, when he endeavors to make it believed that the difficulty of supplying general Washington�s army arose from the disaffection of the country to the cause. I admit that he was in the Winter 1777, in a part of the country where there are more people either cool or disaffected to the cause of America, then in any other on the continent; and yet his want of supplies did not arise from that in the least degree. It arose from the state of our money. If he and his commissaries have had as much hard money is general Howe, he would have had all the provisions in the country laid down at his tent door.
I am not only fully sensible, by a general knowledge of the country in this and other states, that the public mind is entirely on the side of liberty, and for the independence of America � but I could mention a great many facts and circumstances as evidences of it, stronger and could well be imagined, and indeed which have turned out stronger than even my expectations. One circumstance is alone decisive upon the subject, which is well known to yourselves, that the moment your army leaves any part of the country, it is not only lost to you, but returns so strongly to the interest of congress, that all the persons known to have been attached to you are obliged to fly with terror and confusion. But there is another strong circumstance, the universal attachment of the people to the French alliance. In vain have your partisans endeavored to alarm the people with the fears of potpourri and arbitrary power. It makes not the least impression even upon the common people.
Pleased to attend to the circumstance I am going to mention; because it surprised myself when I observed it. There are always, you know, little feuds and contentions, jealousy and emulation, in every society and in every association. Both in congress and in the country, I have observed that when one set or faction wants to make the other odious, they charge them with being cold to the French alliance, and ungrateful to them for their services. This, to my knowledge, has been the subject of mutual reproaches, when I do not believe there was any truth in it on either side. Would you think it � some have seriously attempted to persuade me that the New-England delegates were cold to the French, and inclined to the English; to which I answered, that I well knew the contrary, but that they were of an independent spirit, and would not easily submit to unwarrantable influence, either from the French or the English. I mention all this singly with this view, to shew you the bent and inclination of the public mind.
I have been lately reading over governor Johnston�s speech after his return, in which to my amazement he positively and publicly denies his having sent any message by a lady to Mr. Reed. The thing is now publicly known and confessed. He says they would have named the lady if there had been any such thing. Mr. Reed forbore naming the lady out of tenderness to her; but it has now come out. It was Mrs. F �, daughter of the late Dr. G �, married to Mr. F �, son of R F �, of �. What should people think of persons of his character so boldly and solemnly to deny a certain fact.
I will mention another circumstance to you. The distress of this country by the depreciation of the money, has been very great. Many have suffered great losses; not a few have been utterly ruins. It I never could perceive that this altered the inclination of the people as to the public cause, in the least. Nay, notwithstanding the dreadful complaints made against particular classes of men, such as forestallers and engrossers, commissaries and quartermasters, yet I am persuaded that any body who should but propose to return to submission to England for relief from their depredations, would be torn in pieces.
