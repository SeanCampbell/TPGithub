LETTER VII
March 28, 1774
   SINCE my last letter was sent to the printer, I have a second time looked into the publication therein referred to; and finding it likely to make a strong impression on its readers, as well as that there is the most striking inconsistency between its foundation and superstructure, I perceive that I cannot well pass it over without a regular, tho' concise examination of its third and fourth tract. These alone being immediately to the point, I shall confine my observations to them, without taking notice of the rest of the book.
   In the beginning of the third tract, entitled, "A Letter from a Merchant in London to his Nephew in America," I am sorry to observe an appeal to the spirit of our constitution treated with ridicule, and an attempt made to substitute in place of this only genuine authority, the letter of the statutes, or even of Magna Charta itself; for these may all be imperfect, tho', as I have
proved in a former letter, the spirit of the constitution cannot. A proceeding of this kind in an anonymous writer, or one of no credit, would, I confess, have givers me an alarm of danger, and a suspicion of some deep design against the cause of truth: it certainly is very far from being a recommendation of the present work. May we not ask what is meant by removing the appeal from
the spirit of the constitution to something which is called �the constitution itself," (p. 93, 94) and what that something is? It is not defined, nor can I understand what it is, unless it be a something which hath its sole existence in the varying and unsteady letter of the statute law, and therefore may be one thing to-day, and another to-morrow, as it was once tyranny and popery, and is at present freedom and true religion. If the author will be candid, he must acknowledge, that his distinction of �the constitution itself," from the spirit of the constitution, is unlogical, and a palpable contradiction. How can any thing be set in contradistinction to its essence? That �Magna Charts is the great foundation of English liberties, and the basis of the English constitution," I
must positively deny, It is indeed a glorious member of the superstructure, but of itself would never have existed, had not the constitution already had a basis, and a firm one too, And as to this charter feeing the �foundation of English liberty,'' that was evidently otherwise, since it was an exertion of this very liberty that produced the charter; extorting it from an encroaching King, as
a mere formal declaration of rights, already known to be the constitutional inheritance of every Englishman. Besides, I have elsewhere observed, that the original and only real foundations of liberty were, by the Almighty architect, laid together with the foundations of the world, when this right was ingrafted into the nature of man at his creation; and therefore it cannot be held, after the manner of an external property or possession, by charters and titles of human fabrick. We ought to be careful to preserve a gospel purity in our civil as in our religious constitution; for they are both founded on the word of
God. If the religious be more express and clear, the civil is more antient, and no less divine, though only revealed to us by a general and fainter impress on the mind and heart of man. If the Dean will not admit the decrees of popes and councils as of equal authority with the word of God, he will not surely maintain, that a Magna Charta ought to come in competition with the spirit of a constitution, whose basis is internal justice and inherent liberty; a Magna Charta, notoriously known to have been extorted by the sword, and formed and ratified in the heat of a hostile contention. Nor will he, it is to
be hoped, plead "the public statutes of the realm,� (p. 145) when they militate against the spirit, or gospel purity of the constitution. And here I must remark, that his quotations of them, in order to prove the sovereignty as parliament, have not the weight of fair evidence in the trial now before the tribunal of the public; since they stand in the place, and in the nature of parties concerned.
It is these very "public statutes of the realm," arrogating a right to govern and to tax the Americans which are called in question; therefore their testimony goes for nothing. If the cause be given in their favour, then it will be time enough for them to operate; but if it goes against them, they must all be condemned as usurpations. We are now arguing what is just and right, and ought to be practised, not what has been practised by those who had the power in their hands; not what they have been pleased, in their declarations, to call just and right. Although parliament should enact, that reason and truth
should no longer be reason and truth, yet plain and honest people would be apt to call them reason and truth still, and to rely upon them with the same assurance they do at present. As to the imagination of Great Britain and America being one empire, these are only words that serve to blind, to amuse, and to confound inconsiderate reasoners. How often must it be repeated, that
pride, ambition, and lust of dominion, are not, on any pretence whatsoever, to be gratified at the expence of nations; and that the sole end of civil government is to promote the good of the people? If an empire become too
wide and unwieldy for this purpose, I do assert, that by the laws of nature, which are the laws of God, it is, no empire, that is to say, not a just empire. It therefore must be divided, unless we admit that tyranny can be rightfully established, which God forbid!�
�I entirely agree with this writer, that the member chosen and returned by certain individuals, is the representative of the whole nation; so that what is generally called a virtual, is, in fact, a real representation; but, at the same time I must say it doth not appear to be very consistent with the spirit of our constitution, (if that expression will not give offence) that a Dunwich or an Old Sarum, containing half a dozen cottagers, should have the chusing of as
many of these national representatives as a Norwich or a Bristol; nor that a Weymoath should return as great a number as the metropolis.
�Is not this an abuse that calls aloud for reformation? Can any thing be more notorious, than that a great majority of the national representatives are elected by a small number of indigent and corrupt men, who professedly make
a trade of voting, and who gratify, in the very act, a sordid self-interest, in direct violation of the rights and interests of the nation collectively. These electors being primarily the representatives of the nation, may be called
the elective representatives; and are answerable to the nation for the exercise of that great trust. If they pervert it from the end for which it was given them, and transfer it to bad men for their own selfish purposes, it is fit they
should be deprived of it, in order to the establishing a more just and safe mode of electing the legislative representatives of the nation.�
�it is full as evident, that no man in his senses can see any just similitude,
with respect to parliamentary jurisdiction and taxation between a metropolis, the very central point of a nation, and an entire kindred nation, which hath arisen in the new world, at the distance of three thousand miles from the
parent state, and beyond the vast Atlantic Ocean. It is consistent with the security of the liberty and property of the citizens of London, to be subject to parliamentary jurisdiction and taxation; but this subjection would not be consistent with the security of the American nations. May not a man in his senses believe, that a kindred nation, or a colony, if you please, may be capable of managing its own concerns; and that it is full as likely to do it faithfully as the legislators of its mother country? May not a man in his senses believe, that such a state hath a right to appoint the guardians of its own liberties and properties, and to defend them against all invaders, even the legislators of its mother country, without involving himself in either "folly or absurdity!" Would the independency of any colony or kindred nation in America, necessarily create any such confusion, any such inconsistency in the
government of Great Britain, as would follow from the independency of, and a separate supreme legislation in the capital city?
