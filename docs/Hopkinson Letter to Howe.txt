Mr LORD, 
WHATEVER errors the court of Great Britain might have fallen into in the commencement of the present unhappy contest with America, it was at lead a politic step to commit the conduct of this important affair to your Lordship, and the General your brother. 
THE name of Howe is dear to America; and amongst the many distressing difficulties we have to encounter, it is no inconsiderable one to overcome the predilection we feel for your family. The exalted virtues of your heroic brother, whose bones are embraced by that soil you are now drenching with blood, often rise in painful remembrance. 
WE are ready to acknowledge the good dispositions that distinguish your private character, and whilst we feel the smart of the wounds you inflict, wish they had been administered by another hand. We would fondly consider you as the executioner of another�s wrath - not your own: and forgive with as much sincerity - pardon the allusion! - as the condemned wretch forgives the appointed officer who is about to torture him into another state of existence. 
THE idea we have of your Lordship's character compels us to suppose, that before you undertook this cruel task your conscience was fully convinced, that the inflexible rules of right and honour, and the spirit of the British constitution, fully authorised the present war: and that the resistance of America to the claims of the British legislature is, and ought, to be, deemed rebellion. Under such a supposition, can we blame your Lordship for averting and enforcing what you may believe to be the rights of your sovereign. 
LET the same candour be extended to the poor Americans. They think and are sully persuaded, that neither the rules of honour or equity, the spirit of the British constitution, or the rights of mankind, can authorise the views of Britain in the prosecution of the present war: on the contrary they believe, that is an indispensable duty, which they owe to themselves and their unborn posterity, to oppose to the utmost the troops you have brought into, their country, and to refuse submission to the yoke that is prepared for them. Ought they not then to be respected as acting upon the best principles, however ill-sounded you may suppose these principles to be? And ought you not at least to pity, whilst you think you justly punish?
THE present dispute is, what the rights of the crown and parliament are with respect to America, and what they are not Great Britain would have us acknowledge her claims of unlimited power; and that too, without reasoning on the subject she will not condescend. to reason with us she will not receive our humble petitions, or even hear what we have to say in our own behalf we must implicitly acknowledge her claims to be just. And when, my Lord, were acknowledgements of this kind ever forced upon mankind with success? To own the supremacy of the British parliament over the lives and properties of the people of America, or own the supremacy of his holiness over our immortal souls, are doctrines which can only be established by the sword and the faggot amongst men who have the free use of their reason. But I am, perhaps, going too far � I mean not to offend, nor would I be wanting in the respect due to your character and station. Should my zeal on so interesting a subject appear somewhat intemperate, I trust your Lordship will make a proper allowance, yet suffer me to shed a few tears over the mangled limbs of my bleeding country. 
KNOW then, that devaluation, insult, murder, and ruin mark the way of your savage troops through this cultivated, hospitable, and once happy land. It is not enough that the manly youth, with a heart high-beating in his country's cause, is called forth, and cut down in the field of battle, an early sacrifice at the shrine of Liberty; but the voice of the helpless virgin cries aloud to Heaven against the brutal force of the salacious ravisher. Take a view of the country before you - villages in ruin, cities abandoned, and the miserable inhabitants driven from their comfortable homes, and all the endearing sweets of domestic felicity, to seek for shelter in this inclement season - they know not where - leaving their property a prey to unpitying foreigners, who destroy, without remorse, what they cannot immediately use or conveniently take away. This is no exaggerated picture, over-charged in the colouring facts have justified the drawing, and the mournful occasion prompts the stile. 
SUCH is the nature of the commission you have come to execute amongst us. Cruel as it is, I Would fain hope that you think you are only brandishing the sword of justice, not inflicting the rod of oppression - but how you can think so, it is hard for an American to conceive. 
THE unpardonable fault of America now is the declaration of Independence. When our faults were less they were as hardly thought of. Our modest complaints were called presumption - our humble petitions dismissed with contempt - no lenient hand was held out - no friendly measures proposed to sooth the griefs we thought we suffered, and prevent the horrors that now surround us - independence was not the wish of America, but a hard and cruel necessity has forced us to this desperate determination - we trust in the justice of our cause, and leave to the God of battles the great event. 
IN the mean time, though you carry on your master's work, let not the lawless hand of rapine spread unnecessary desolation through our bleeding country - Arrest the plunderer's greedy grasp, and suffer not the cries of the despoiled virgin to call to Heaven for vengeance on those who regard not God, and trample on the sacred rights of humanity. Wrongs like these, tarnish the lustre of victory, and blast the laurels of the brave.
