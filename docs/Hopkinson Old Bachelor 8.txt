I MIGHT have sat in my elbow chair till dooms-day, and revolved the matter over and over again, till my brain had become as dry as a box of Scotch snuff. I might have wasted the midnight lamp; read all the works of the learned, and of the unlearned, upon the subject; and even out-studied Duns Scotus, without being able to determine the point. 'Tis very strange, said I, that any speculation what ever, should be supported and contradicted, established and confuted by reasons so exactly balancing each other as to leave the judgement hanging in suspence like Mahomet's coffin. The hundred-thousandth part of a grain would set all agoing; and yet I cannot throw that hundred-thousandth part of a grain into one scale, but I find just as much hath dropped into the opposite. In a word, I found it impossible to determine, whether I had better marry or not. 
AT last, an accident - who would have thought it! - an accident settled this important question; broke down the dam which I had been so many years building up, strengthening and repairing, and let out all my objections at once in a torrent. It would have surprised any body to see how many 
prudential motives, self-love, avarice, pride, peculiarities of opinion, &c. tumbled out, helter skelter, head-over-heels, in the gushing dream. Here lay Pride, bouncing and flouncing indignant through the foaming tide; there lay Avarice, wriggling and twitting in mud and slime  - On one side, Self-love, like a tortoise, collected within its own unsocial shell; on the other, thousands of odd notions  and peculiarities of opinion crawling about like snails, tad-poles, and unformed vermin. 
BUT the accident, which occasioned this extraordinary revolution, is worth relating - 
I acquainted you in a former letter, with my illness and recovery. For the better establishment  of my health, exercise and air were much recommended. I made it a practice, therefore, when ever the weather was suitable, to walk two or three miles before dinner. One day, as I was taking my usual excursion along the road that leads to the lower ferry on Schulkyl, two women passed me in a chair. The youngest of the two drew the attention of a momentary glance. I thought I saw something in her that made me wish for a longer view. They had not proceeded above an hundred yards when their horse took fright, ran up against the fence, and overset the chair. I made all possible haste to the assistance of the unfortunate ladies. The elder seemed to have received no great injury; but the young lady, either from the force of the fall, or through fear, had fainted away. I took her in my arms; her head reclined upon my bosom - she was delicate - she was lovely: I felt an anxiety I never felt before. Love, though I knew it not, stole into my heart under the disguise of compassion. I chafed her temples, her wrists, and the palms of her hands. The soft touch thrilled through every vein, and awakened unusual sensibilities. She recovered, and, observing her situation, with a gentle effort, disengaged herself from my arms, and thanked me for my care with graceful ease and a languishing voice. The elder lady, who was her mother, joined in acknowledgements. The horse and broken chair were left at a neighbouring house, and I insisted on conducting the ladies home. 
LITTLE passed during this walk but thankful expressions on the part of the ladies, and polite assurances on mine. I did not fail, however, to examine the young lady's person and deportment with great attention, and the more I observed the more I was pleased with her. As they were both much discomposed by the accident, I did not think it proper to intrude upon them at that time; but took my leave at the door, with a promise to wait upon them the next day to enquire after their health. 
WHEN I returned home, this adventure engrossed all my thoughts ; I secretly wished myself some twenty years younger, that I might with propriety make this aimable young woman all my own. What a treasure, said I, must she be to a man of sense and delicacy: How happy should I be at this time if I had, in the earlier part of my life, connected myself with such a sweet companion but I have missed the golden opportunity, and must e'en fret out the remainder of my days as well as I can. 
THE day was long the night longer. The next morning was chiefly spent in preparations for my afternoon's visit. I was uncommonly particular about my dress, although I had no determined object in view. The barber had express orders respecting the dressing of my wig; my best suit of broad-cloth was taken out of the press, and my new beaver neatly and carefully brushed. In short, I was more attentive to my preparations for this visit than I had been for many years. But I placed all to the account of politeness and civility. 
WHEN all was ready, I went to the glass to adjust my wig. I thought I looked uncommonly  well  - at least I observed a neatness in my dress and a vivacity in my countenance to which I had long been unaccustomed. Certain reflections arose in my mind which I could not then suppress. And  thus I reasoned with myself. Few men carry their age better than I do - this must be owing to the temperance and regularity of my pass'd life. A discreet man of fifty hath the powers of life in greater vigour than a debauchee of twenty-five. Who knows what may happen? - perhaps - Oh! the enchanting idea! - stranger things have come to pass - my fortune is unexceptionable - my person, I think, not disagreeable, and my constitution rather better since my late illness than before. At this instant I took up my hat which lay on the table close by an old quarto Family Bible, the corner of my hat, in lifting it, took hold of the upper cover of the Bible and threw it back - when behold! on the first leaf of the aforesaid Bible, these words, in very legible characters, saluted my eye "George, the son of Thomas and Alice Sanby, was born in the city of London, on the 10th day of October anno Domini ****" - I need  not give you the figures - suffice it to say, that this malicious accident had a great effect on my mind. It struck the top-fails of my vanity in a moment, and dispersed all the gay ideas I had conjured up. I left home somewhat disconcerted; and many jarring sensibilities distracted my mind till I got to the house where I was to make my visit. 
IT is time to inform you that the mother of this young lady keeps shop in __ street: upon the profits of which, and the interest of a thousand pounds left her by her deceased husband, she supports herself and her only daughter - Her husband had been a merchant of some note; but partly by loses in trade, and chiefly by living too expensively for his income, had it not in his power to leave any thing considerable to his family. This intelligence I artfully obtained from an acquaintance in the common way of chat. 
I was received by my new friends with great cordiality. The mother was all complaisance and civility, the daughter all sweetness and innocence. Our discourse first turned upon the accident of the preceding day. I was happy in finding it attended with no bad consequences; and happier still (as I took occasion to observe) it had been the means of introducing me to such an agreeable family; declaring my intention to take advantage of it by occasional visits. To this a reply was made quite to my satisfaction. I spent the afternoon and a good part of the evening most agreeably. I returned home in high spirits, and much enamoured with the young lady. I thought no more of the accident of the family Bible, but indulged myself for the remainder of the night in a thousand golden dreams. 
Now, if ever you expect to hear from me again, I insist that you do not entitle this, or any subsequent letter from me, The Old Bachelor. I am not so old perhaps as you may imagine. I dare say Methuselah was in leading-strings at my age, or just beginning to cut his teeth. A man so hearty and ruddy as I am, cannot with any propriety be called Old ï¿½ Old philosopher, Old hermit, Old married men. Old widower, may be well enough - but old should never be applied to a bachelor until he is a great deal older than I am yet - thank God! You may alledge that in some of my letters I have called myself an Old Bachelor - but I was not well then, and somewhat low spirited - I did myself great injustice, and have a right to recall the expression - which I now do - Indulge me in this particular, and perhaps you may hear from me again.
