OBSERVATIONS ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF AMERICA
North America is at present from the natural course of things, and a growing state. It will therefore of itself, for a series of years, gradually improve. There are however many things by which that improvement may be facilitated or retarded; and it is the laudable purpose of this society, to attend to the circumstances with care, and use their utmost endeavors to encourage the one then to remove the other. Having had the honor of being admitted a member of this society, and not having it much in my power any otherwise to promote American improvements, I could not resist the inclination I felt to digest and put in writing, a few reflections upon the police of countries in general, the great principles on which the Philadelphia Society ought to proceed, and perhaps I may propose some particular regulations.
1. The moral causes of the prosperity of the country, are almost infinitely more powerful than those that are only occasional. This observation is taken from Montesquieu, by whom it is admirably illustrated, and it ought never to be out of you, with those who wish to promote the general good. The moral causes arise from the nature of the government, including the administration of justice, liberty of conscience, the partition of property. The rise of a particular town, the cultivation and beauty of a particular quarter of the country, may sometimes be justly ascribed to this prizing effects of a single person who set the example; yet he was only the occasion, properly speaking, of the vigorous exertion. The consequences could never be general or lasting, if there was not a disposition to it in the constitution of the country. Therefore, a sacred regard should be had by every lover of mankind, to the principles of equity and liberty, that they may never be violated by any public proceedings. Pennsylvania is so happy in this particular. That its constitution need not be improved, but preserved and defended.
2. It is extremely difficult, after you depart from general principles, to discover what particular regulations will be for the interest of the country. It requires a very comprehensive mind, and a thorough knowledge of the course of trade and police in general. Besides, it is not only difficult, but impossible to for see what circumstances may afterwards occur. Many things are useful and expedient at one time, which in a few years become unnecessary or hurtful. Nay, many selfish laws have operated from the beginning, in a manner directly contrary to what was expected. The incorporation of trades in the cities in Britain, is an instance of the first: an almost every law made to the prejudice of Ireland, is an example of the last.



On the CONTROVERSY about INDEPENDENCE.
Sir,
I beg leave by your assistance, to publish a few thoughts upon the manner of conducting, what I think is now called the independent controversy, in which this country in general is so greatly interested. Every one knows that when the claims of the British Parliament were openly made, and violently enforced, the most precise and determined resolutions were entered into, and published by every colony, every county, and almost every Township or smaller district, that they would not submit to them. This was clearly expressed in the greatest part of them, and ought to be understood as the implied sense of them all, not only that they would not soon or easily, but that they would never on any event, submit to them. For my own part, I confess, I would never have signed these resolves at first, there taken up arms in consequence of them afterwards, if I had not been fully convinced, as I am still, that acquiescence in this usurped power, would be followed by the total and absolute ruin of the colonies. They would have been no better than tributary states to a kingdom at a great distance from them. They would have been therefore, as has been the case with all states in the similar situation from the beginning of the world, the servants of servants from generation to generation. For this reason I declare it to have been my meaning, and I know it was the meaning of thousands more, that though we are earnestly wished for reconciliation with safety to our liberties, get we did deliberately prefer, not only the horrors of the Civil War, not only the danger of anarchy, and the uncertainty of the new settlement, but even extermination itself to slavery, rivetted on us and our posterity.
The most peaceable means were first used; but no relaxation could be obtained: one arbitrary and oppressive act followed after another; they destroy the property of a whole capital � subverted to its very foundation, the constitution and government of a whole colony, and granted the soldiers a liberty of murdering in all the colonies. I express it thus, because they were not to be called to account for it where it was committed, which every body must allow was a temporary, and undoubtedly, inninety-nine cases in an hundred, must have issued in a total impunity. There is one circumstance however in my opinion, much more curious than all the rest. The reader will say, What can this be? It is the following, which I beg may be particularly attended to: � while all this was a doing, the King in his speeches, the parliament in their acts, and the people of Great-Britain in their addresses, never failed to extol their own lenity. I do not infer from this, that the King, Parliament and people of Great-Britain are all barbarians and savages � the inference is unnecessary and unjust: but I infer the misery of the people of America, if they must submit in all cases whatsoever, to the decisions of a body of the sons of Adam, so distant from them, and to have an interest in oppressing them. It has been my opinion from the beginning, that we did not carry our reasoning fully home, when we complained of an arbitrary prince, or of the insolence, cruelty and oxidant see of Lord North, Lord Bute, or Lord Mansfield. What we have to fear, and what we have now to grapple with, is the ignorance, prejudice, partiality and injustice of human nature. Neither king nor ministry, could have done, nor durst have attempted but we have seen, if they had not had the nation on their side. The friends of America in England are few in number, and contemptible in influence; nor must I omit, that even of these few, not one, till very lately, ever reason the American cause upon its proper principles, or viewed it in its proper light.
Petitions on petitions have been presented to king and Parliament, and address sent to the people of Great-Britain, which have been not merely fruitless, but treated with the highest degree of disdain. The conduct of the British ministry during the whole of this contest, as has been often observed, has been such, as to irritate the whole people of this continent to the highest degree, and unite them together by the firm bond of the necessity and common interest. In this respect they have served us in the most essential manner. I am firmly persuaded, that had the wisest heads in America met together to contrive what measures the ministry should follow to strengthen the American opposition and defeat their own designs, they could not have fallen upon a plan so effectual, as that which has been steadily pursued. One instance I cannot help mentioning, because it was both of more importance, and less to be expected than any other. When a majority of the New-York Assembly, to their eternal infamy, attempted to break the union of the colonies, by refusing to approve the proceedings of the Congress, and applying to Parliament by separate petition � because they presume to make mention of the principal grievance of taxation, it was treated with ineffable contempt. I desire it may be observed, that all those who are called the friends of America in Parliament, pleaded strongly for receiving the New-York petition; which plainly shewed, that neither the one nor the other understood the state of affairs in America. Had the ministry been prudent, or the opposition successful, we had been ruined; but with what transport did every friend to American liberty here, that these traitors to the common cause, had met with the reception which they deserved.
Nothing is more manifest, then that the people of Great-Britain, and even the king and ministry, have been hitherto exceedingly ignorant of the state of things in America. For this reason, there measures have been ridiculous in the highest degree, and the issue disgraceful. There are some who will not believe that they are ignorant � they tell us, how can this be? Have they not multitudes in this country, who gave them intelligence from the beginning? Yes they have; but they would trust none but what they called official intelligence, that is to say, from obsequious, interested tools of government; many of them knew little of the true state of things themselves, and when they did, would not tell it, lest it should be disagreeable. I have not a very high opinion of the integrity and candor of Dr. C �, Dr. C �, and other mercenary writers in New-York; it I firmly believe, that they thought the friends of American liberty much more in considerable, both for weight and numbers, then they were. They conversed with few, but those of their own way of thinking, and according to the common deception of little minds, mistook the sentiments prevailing within the circle of their own acquaintance, for the judgment of the public.
