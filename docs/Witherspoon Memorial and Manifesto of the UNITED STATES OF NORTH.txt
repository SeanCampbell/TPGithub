Memorial and Manifesto of the UNITED STATES OF NORTH-AMERICA,
To the Mediating Powers in the Conferences for Peace, to the other Powers in Europe, and in general to all who shall see the same,
The United States of North-America, having been made acquainted, by their illustrious ally the king of France, that there is a proposal for holding a Congress under the mediation of the Empress of Russia and the Emperor of Germany, to treat of terms of accommodation with Great-Britain have thought proper to publish, for the information of all concerned, the following memorial, which shall contain a brief detail of the steps by which they have been brought into their present interesting and critical situation.
The United States (formerly British colonies) you were first planted and settled by emigrants from that country. These settlers came out at different times, and with different views. Some were actuated by the spirit of curiosity and enterprise, which was so prevalent in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; some were chiefly induced by the hope of riches; and some were driven from their native country by the iron rod of sacerdotal tyranny. They solicited their charters, and settled their governments on different principles, such as best please those who were chiefly concerned in each undertaking. In one thing, however, they all agreed, that they consider themselves as bringing their liberty with them, and as entitled to all the rights and privileges of free men under the British constitution.
Pursuant to these sentiments, they looked upon it as the foundation stone of British liberty, that the freeholders or proprietors of the soil, should have the exclusive right of granting money for public uses, and therefore invariably preceded upon this plan. With respect, indeed, to the whole of their internal government, they consider themselves as not directly subject to the British parliament, but as separate independent dominions under the same sovereign, and with similar co-ordinate jurisdiction. It appears from several events, that happened in the course of their history, and from public acts of some of their governments, that this was their opinion many years before the late unjust claims and oppressive acts, which gave birth to the bloody conflict not yet finished.
From the first settlement of the colonies, they willingly submitted to Britain�s enjoying an exclusive right to their commerce; the several of the acts of the British parliament upon this subject, they always looked upon as partial and unjust. Some of these appear, at first view, to be such batches of servitude, that is surprising that a free people should ever have been patient under them. The truth is, they would not probably have been submitted to, but that the rigid execution of them at this distance was in its nature impossible.
It was always the opinion of the inhabitants of these states, that the benefits which arose to Britain from the exclusive commerce of America, and the taxes which it enabled her to raise on her own subjects, was more than their proportion of the common treasure necessary to the defense of the empire. At the same time, great as it was, the loss to them, by being confined in their trade, was greater than the benefit to her; as it obliges them to purchase any saying they had occasion for from her, and at her own price, which necessarily retarded their growth and improvement. All this notwithstanding, when any extraordinary emergency scene to render it necessary, and when application was regularly made to the assemblies of the colonies, they complied in every instance with the requisitions, and made advances of Psalms which, in one or two instances, Britain herself considered as above their ability, and therefore made restitution or compensation for them.
The true reason of this long and patient acquiescence, was the natural and warm attachment which the inhabitants of America had to Great-Britain, as their parent country. They gloried in their relation to her; they were zealous for her honor and interest; imbibed her principles and prejudices with respect to other nations; entered into her quarrels, and were profuse of their blood for the purpose of securing and extending her dominion. Almost every city and county in Great Britain had its counterpart, which boards name in the New World; and those whose progenitors for three generations had been born in America, when they spoke of going to Britain, called it going home.
Such was the state of things, when some unwise counselors to the British king, thought of raising a revenue without the consent of the American legislatures, to be carried directly to the English treasury. The first essay on the subject was the famous stamp act, of which we shall at present say nothing, but that the universal ferments raised on occasion of it was a clear proof of the justness and truth of the preceding representation. So odious was it over the whole country, and so dangerous to those who attempted to carried into execution, that in the short time it was repealed by themselves. Parliament, however, by their declaratory act, which passed in the same session shewed that they intended to maintain the right, though they�d desisted in this instance from the exercise of it, The Americans, overjoyed at the immediate deliverance, returned to their affection and attachment, hoping that the claim would again become dormant and that no occasion would be given for the future discussion of it.
But it was not long before the English ministry proposed and carried an act of parliament, imposing duties on T, glass, &c. which by the smallness of the duties themselves, and several other circumstances, was plainly designed to steal upon us gradually, and if possible imperceptibly, the exercise of their pretended right. It was not, however, in their power to blind the colonies, who rose up against the execution of this act, with zeal or portions to the importance of the subject, and with an unanimity not to be expected but where are great and common danger keeps every cause of jealousy and dissension out of view. Not only every colony, by its representative body, but every County, and almost every corporation or other subordinate division, publicly declared that they would defend their liberty at the risk of their estates and lives. In the mean while the English government professed a determination equally firm to enforce the execution of this act by military power, I�m bring us to unconditional submission.
Thus did the rupture take place; and as to the justice of our cause, we must say, that if any impartial persons will read the declaratory act, that the lords and commons of Great-Britain in parliament, have a right to make laws binding upon the colonies in all cases whatsoever, and which was now producing its proper fruit, he must be convinced that had we submitted to it, we should have been in no respect different from a set of conquered, tributary states, subject to a foreign country; in the colonial assemblies would have become both useless and contemptible. The writings in England upon the subject, proving that we were misrepresented in Middlesex, and using many other equally forcible arguments, are and will remain a disgrace to reason, as well as an insult on American understanding.
At this period of time not only the people of England in general, but the king of England in his speeches, and his parliament in their addresses, affected to represent the commotions in America as raised by a few seditious persons, and the consequence of a pre-concerted scheme to throw off the dominion of Great-Britain, and set up an independent empire. This unjust and indeed absurd accusation may be refuted by a thousand arguments. The strong predilection of the people of America for the people, the fashions, and the government of Britain, proves its falsehood. There was no person, nor any number of persons in any state of America, who had such influence as to be able to effect this, or even view it as a probable object of ambition. But what must demonstrate the absurdity of this supposition, is the state in which America was found when she began to grapple with the power of Britain. No step had been taken to open the way for obtaining foreign aid. No provision had been made of arms, ammunition, or warlike stores of any kind; so that the country seemed to be exposed, naked and helpless, to the dominion of her enemy.
Agreeably to this, addresses and petitions with the means to which we had recourse. Reconciliation to Britain, with the security and preservation of our rights, was the wish of every soul. The most explicit professions of loyalty to the prince, and the most express assurances of effectual support in his government, if we were called on in a constitutional way, made the substance of our declarations. Every succeeding petition, however, was treated with new and greater insult, and was answered by acts of parliament, which further cruelty will be a stain upon the annals of the kingdom, and bring the character of the nation itself into disgrace.
Single acts of inhumanity may be accounted for from the depravity of an individual; but what shall we say of grave and numerous assemblies, enacting such laws as the Boston port bill, which reduced at once so many people to beggary, and the property itself to nothing � the act permitting those charged with murdering Americans, to be sent to England to be tried, that is to say, they�re not to be tried at all, or certainly absolving � the act appointing Americans taken at sea, to be turned before the mast in English ships, and obliged either to kill their own relations, or be killed by them � in the act appointing American prisoners to be sent to the East-Indies as slaves. But what is of almost astonishing is, that they never fail to extol their own lenity, when passing such acts as filled this whole continent with resentment and horror. To crown the whole, the last petition sent by congress to the king, which beseeched him to appoint some mode by which our complaints might be remedied, and a way be paved for reconciliation, was treated with absolute contempt, and no answer given to it of any kind. Thus was all intercourse broken up. We were declared rebels; and they themselves must confess, that no alternative was left us, but you to go with ropes about our necks, and submit ourselves, not to the king, but to the kingdom of England, to be trampled underfoot, or risk all the consequences of open and vigorous resistance.
The last part of the alternative we chose without hesitation; and as it was impossible to preserve civil order any longer under the name and form of the government which we had taken arms to oppose, we found it absolutely necessary to declare ourselves independent of that prince who had thrown us out of his protection. This great step was taken with the full approbation, and indeed at the ardent desire of the public at large. The extent and growth of the colonies seemed, in the nature of things, to call for such a separation long before; it would not probably have happened for many years, if it had not been forced upon us by the conduct over unkind parent herself. � This thing indeed seems to have been the purpose of God Almighty; for every measure of the court of Great-Britain had the most direct tendency to hasten, and render it unavoidable.
We must take notice, that before the declaration of independence, there was something like an attempt to reconcile us, commonly called lord North�s conciliatory motion; but was so trifling in its nature, and insidious in its form, but probably no success was expected from it, even by those who contrived it. Who does not perceive in it and artful attempt to divide us? and that while every thing else is left in the greatest uncertainty, the main point for which we contended is clearly decided against us?
After the declaration of independence, lord and general Howe brought out a commission for giving peace to America. But as they had not liberty so much as to wood knowledge of us by an open treaty, so the substance of what they offered was pardon upon submission; that the parliament would revise the acts they had passed, and if any of them were found improper, they would amend them: which, in one word, amounted to this, that they would do for us what they themselves thought good. These offers, however, poor as they were, came too late. So important a step as the declaration of independence, could not be recalled; and the formidable armament sent out against us in the year 1776, rendered it more necessary than ever.
We are sorry to be obliged to take notice of the manner of conducting the war. It would be for the honor of humanity, that it could be buried in oblivion. Many were the instances of persons, after they had submitted and begged mercy on their knees, being murdered in cold blood. The treatment of prisoners was from the beginning, and has continued through the war, with some exceptions, Savage and barbarous to the last degree. Multitudes, before any exchange took place, died by famine and stench. Many were, by threatening an ill usage, constraints to enlist in their enemies service; and many were forced on board their ships of war, or sent to Britain to rot in prison, at a distance from their friends, without hope of relief. It is not easy to enumerate the houses and even towns which have been wantonly burnt, or to describe the devastation of the country, and robbery of the inhabitants, wherever the army passed. To this may be added, hiring the savages to come upon the back settlements. There is a greater shame in this expedient, that they are not formidable either for their number or their valor, but for the shocking manner in which they torture their prisoners, and murder women and infants who fall into their hands. Civilized nations will perhaps find it hard to believe this representation; but every part of it can be supported by the most unquestionable facts, and it is rendered credible not only by the circumstance that civil wars are carried on commonly with a rancor and animosity greater than those between independent nations, but by the expressions of hatred and contempt which have been use with respect to the Americans, by almost every speaker and writer in England. What effect could such language have on the minds of the soldiery, but to steal them against all impressions of pity and tenderness, as we find it was really the case, so they were restrained in some degree, by the fear of retaliation upon their people in our hands.
At last, after four years of real, and near two years of professed and declared independence, it pleased God to incline the heart of the king of France to give relief to the oppressed, by entering into a treaty with the United States, on the most liberal and disinterested principles. No exclusive privileges are there stipulated for the French nation, but the secure, open and equal intercourse to which all other nations are invited. This acknowledgment and support from one of the most powerful monarchs in Europe, it may easily be supposed gave a new turn to our affairs, and a new dignity to our cause. The terms of this treaty, so favorable to us, as well as honorable to our ally, cannot fail to add the bond of gratitude to that of justice, and make our appearance to it inviolable.
Not long after this treaty was signed, the court and parliament of Great-Britain sent out commissioners to make an offer of terms, which we readily confess were not only as good, but better, the what three years before would have been cheerfully accepted. But the ground was now wholly changed. We were offered freedom from taxes, and even a species of independence itself, upon the easy terms of breaking our faith so lately pledged, and uniting our force with that of Great-Britain; and both would doubtless have been immediately employed in taking vengeance on France for the assistance she had lent to us in our distress. Yet even here, the hole was to be subject to the revision of parliament; that is to say, any part of the agreement might be approved or rejected as to the wisdom of that assembly should seem meet.
These last proposals from Great-Britain, deserve very particular notice. They are a clear dereliction of the first cause of quarrel, and an ample confession that the demands of America were just; while the time and circumstances of their being made, shew that they could not be accepted with any regard either to justice, gratitude, or policy. Could we be guilty of a direct breach of faith, when the ink was hardly dry by which our ratification of the treaty was marked? Could we instantly forget those favors which had been so earnestly solicited, as well as generously bestowed? Could we, who had not entered into a league offensive and defensive with France, except for the present struggle in our own behalf, because we did not wish to be involved in the wars of Europe, throw ourselves into the arms of an hostile nation, and promised to make peace or war with terror, against our benefactors?
Upon the whole, since the American colonies were, from their extent and situation, right for separation from Great-Britain, in the nature of things seem to demand it; since their growing power, added to that of Great-Britain, would give her such a dominion of the sea, as must be dangerous to the liberty and commerce of other nations; since, by her own acts of oppression, she has alienated the minds of the Americans, and compelled them to establish independent governments, which have now taken place; and since these governments, which are distinct though confederated, wholly settled upon republican principles and fit only for agriculture and commerce, cannot be an object of jealousy to other powers, but by free and open intercourse with them a general benefit to all; it is to be hoped that the revolution which they have effected, will meet with universal approbation.
