THE MERIDIAN SUN OF LIBERTY
by Thomas Spence�
�first published 1796
Citizen Reader. Pray what is all this you make ado about Landlords, and Tenants, and Parishes? We don't understand you. 
Author. That is surprising. I thought I had been very plain. But none are so blind as those who will not see. But the reason why I trouble you with my little publications, is, that I wish to teach you the Rights of Man. 
Reader. Rights of Man! What? � Don't we yet know enough of the Rights of Man? 
Author. No. 
Reader. No! do you say? After all that Paine, Thelwall, and other Philosophers, and the French Republic have taught us, do we not yet know the Rights of Man? 
Author. No. 
Reader. Does not the whole Rights of Man consist in a fair, equal, and impartial representation of the People in Parliament? 
Author. No. Nobody ought to have right of suffrage or representation in a society wherein they have no property. As more are suffered to meddle in the affairs of a benefit society or corporation, but those who are members, by having a property therein, so none have a right to vote or interfere in the affairs of the government of a country who have no right to the soil; because such are and ought to be accounted strangers. 
Reader. Do you then account men born in a country as strangers to it, and unworthy of suffrage, that unfortunately may have no title to landed property? 
Author. Most certainly I do. Especially such men as being afraid to look their rights in the face, have disfranchised and alienated themselves, by denying and renouncing all claim to the soil of their birth, and profess to be content with the "Rights of property in the fruits of their industry, ingenuity, and good fortune". This is the right to property that a Hottentot, a Chinese, or a native of the Moon may claim among us, as well as you. Wherefore, as you are content with the property of a foreigner, pray do likewise be content with the privileges of a foreigner. 
Reader. I tell you, we have a right to universal suffrage, as well as to the fruits of our labour. 
Author. And I tell you, that such Lacklanders as you have no right to suffrage at all. For you are to all intent and purposes as much foreigners as the Jews. For if birth gave a title many of them might claim as much as you, having been in the country, and perhaps too through as many generations. So it is not birth but property that gives right of suffrage in a society. Sure you do not, by your suffrages, want to interfere in the estate and properties of other men? You own that the landed interest are the legal proprietors of their estates, and of course, the legal possessors of the fountains of life; and yet, by your universal suffrage, you want to modify to your liking, those very estates which you allow to be private property! � You say that no one has a right to set a price on your labour, yet you want to cramp others in the disposal of what you allow to be as much their right. You say you would abolish the right of primogeniture; you would tax all estates according to their value; prevent the monopoly of farms; abolish the game-laws; and this � and thus � at your whim, you would fashion, reduce, melt and pare down private property, contrary to your own fundamental maxims of right and wrong. Pray be consistent; and let us know, before you begin, where you mean to leave off. If the Rights of Man be definable, as I believe they are, let them be accurately defined, and then let them be sacred. This is the only way to procure unanimity of sentiment, and prevent anarchy. Is it necessary that our rights, like the rainbow, should always recede from us as we advance? And they today to be subject to this decree, and tomorrow to that, as if pleaseth a few of our leading demagogues, who only wish us to know in part, that they may lead us like men upon a secret expedition. Does not this look as if they longed to fish in dark and troubled waters? 
Reader. Are we then, because we have no land, to do nothing in our own defence against oppression? 
Author. If you don't like the country, and the oppression in it, pray leave it. You have no more right to this country than to any other. While you allow the justice of private property in land, you justify everything the landed interest do, both in their own estates and in the Government, for the country is theirs; and what you call oppression, is only their acting consistently with their interest, and they certainly have a right to govern their own property, and what affects it. So as by your own confession you have neither part nor lot among them, you are of consequence only strangers and sojourners. Wherefore the landed interest act infinitely more consistently is debarring such unprincipled Legislators from interfering among them, than you do in demanding rights which are inexplicable. Noble architects, truly; who would pull down before you know what to build. Who, to serve some temporary purpose, perhaps of plunder, would put all things in a state of requisition, and then suffer matters to end in as much, perhaps more, oppression than they begun. This is not establishing the immoveable Temple of Justice, but erecting the wavering standard of Robbery. 
Reader. And pray what do you call the Rights of Man? 
Author. Read this Lecture, which I have been publishing in various editions for more than twenty years. There you will see the Whole Rights of Man without reserve. There you will see how far men ought to go in recovering their rights, and where, to a hair's breadth, they ought to stop. 
Of kings and courtiers how the fools complain! Nor blame their word inord'nate love of gain. None think that while dire landlords they allow, To kings and knaves they'll still be doom'd to bow.
