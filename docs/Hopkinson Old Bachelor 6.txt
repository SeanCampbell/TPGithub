OH, that I had been made an oyster! - that I had been stationed in the bottom of the sea the winds might have blown and swelled the waves mountains high; I should not have heeded them. Mankind might have satiated themselves with folly, iniquity and deceit; it would not have troubled me. But, what is better than all, I should have propagated my species by a numerous offspring, without the cares, without the plagues, without the expences of a female assistant. 
HERE some journeyman philosopher would interrupt me with a learned dissertation on sexes; and prove, by a chain of irrefragible suppositions, that oysters are male and female. What's that to you, sir? Who asked your opinion? The deuce is in these coxcombs, that they cannot let a man go on in his own way, but they must be throwing draws across his path. Go, Mr. Philosopher, go, catch butterflies, and search for the pineal gland of a musketoe. 
OH, that I had been an oyster! - 'Tis true I should not have known what are called the joys of life; that is, I should not have eaten turtle-soup and venison till I nauseated both, nor have drank Madeira till I loathed it.  - True, - neither should I be tormented with the treachery of servants, the hypocrisy of relations, or the insults and sarcasms of my fellow oysters. 
You should have heard from me before this, Mr. Aitken, but I have been sick, very sick, - almost at the point of death; I caught cold by putting on a damp shirt. - If I had been married, my wife, perhaps, would have taken care that my linen should have been well aired - perhaps not. Be this as it may, I caught cold, and was very sick. Nobody troubled their heads about me; I lay helpless, languishing and neglected above; my servants rioted and plundered below; every thing ran into confusion. The common comforts of the sick were not administered to me; I lay many hours alone, brooding over my own melancholy reflections. I thought I should die  -I supposed myself dead  - I saw my own funeral Not a single tear to embalm my memory. A few straggling neighbours attend the scanty procession, conversing on politics, or the current news of the day, as they follow me to the grave. The day after the funeral, some person of the next street asks one of my near neighbours, "Pray, how does the Old Bachelor? I hear he is sick." ï¿½He was sick, but he is well enough now _ he 
was buried yesterday." - "Dear me! I never heard of it - and how has the old curmudgeon left his estate? - "To the Pennsylvania Hospital." No more is said about me - they pass on to other chat. After three days, I am no more thought of than if I had never existed, except by the managers of the Pennsylvania Hospital. No widow to be visited and comforted for the loss of me - no children to keep my name and memory alive in the world, and to talk of their dear father, some ten or a dozen years after my decease. No elegy in verse or prose to celebrate the virtues I never possessed, or palliate the faults I really had. Not even a paragraph in the newspaper to announce my departure - Yes - I had some comfort in supposing that my name might creep into the fag-end of your Magazine, under the lift of deaths, with a declaration that I had charitably left my estate to the Pennsylvania Hospital. 
SUCH was the dismal train of ideas that presented to my imagination. My disorder encreased, my life was despaired of. Some half a dozen second and third cousins came to see me. They disgusted me with their officious and overacted kindnesses. 
"Why did you sot send, my dear cousin, to let me know you was sick?" "I never heard a word of it till this morning, and I came the moment I was informed of your danger." Says another, - "Do take this." - " Pray try that." --"There is nothing better for a fever, I have known it to do wonders." Another of my very loving cousins sat down by my bedside, and with a doleful countenance began a lecture upon the uncertainty of life, and the certainty of death. After a few common place observations he came to the point he had in view. "I hope, my dear cousin, (said he) 
that you have settled your worldly affairs; your loving relations expect it of you; I hope you have made your will; these things had better not be delayed; it will be an ease to your mind when that necessary business is over, and you will not die an hour the sooner for having completed it. We all hope you may recover; God grant you may! But, as we are all mortal, and know not how soon we may be called upon, it is prudent to provide against the word." I told him that my will was already made, and that I had no inclination to alter it. My cousins continued to tease me with  unremitting cruelty; my strength was so exhausted that I could not scold, storm and swear, as I wished to do. I fretted inwardly; my physician, too, was in league with my cousins; he denied me every thing I desired, and forced upon me every thing I loathed and abhorred; my situation was truly deplorable. I earnestly longed for a draught of cold water; I requested it in terms of the most pathetic felicitation; but to no purpose. At length I prevailed upon an old negro wench, who is not worth a farthing, and yet the most valuable servant I have got, to bring me, privately, a tankard of water fresh from the pump. I drank it off greedily. It threw me into a profuse sweat and deep sleep - it saved my life - I began to recover. No sooner was I out of danger, but my loving cousins, whom I had not seen for four years before my illness, left me with one consent: and it is more than probable, that they will not visit me again for four years to come - Heaven grant they may not! But I fancy I need be under no apprehensions on that account, as they will discover by this paper that I mean to leave my estate to the Pennsylvania Hospital. 
SUCH is the forlorn state of an Old Bachelor. Sick or well there is none will do him a service, or even an act of charity, but from interested motives. I sometimes wish I had married when I was young ; but when I look round amongst my acquaintance, and see a tyrannical and extravagant wife, a reprobate spendthrift son, and a daughter, running off with the first vagabond that offers, I hug myself in my solitary state, and bless my stars that I did not marry when I was young. 
UPON the whole, I find so many reasons to wish myself a married man; and I see so many reasons to rejoice that I am not; that my mind is like the pendulum of a clock hanging in suspense, and perpetually vibrating between two opinions. 
NOTWITHSTANDING all the fine things that have been said, time out of mind, about the married slate, I am persuaded that he who marries must venture boldly. It is not a subject that will bear much reasoning upon. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred it is passion or interest, not reason, that points to matrimony. Should a man, before he 
engages, call up to view all the disasters, troubles, and inconveniences, some of which probably may, and others certainly will, occur in the married state, he would never have the courage to engage in it. In my youthful days I fancied myself in love two or three times; I even made some advances towards a courtship: but I reasoned too much on the consequences, and therefore I- remain, as you see, a fretful Old Bachelor.
