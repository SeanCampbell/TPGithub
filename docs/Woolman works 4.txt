From the yearly meeting in Virginia I went to Carolina; and, on the first of sixth month, was at Wells monthly meeting, where the spring of the gospel ministry was opened, and the love of Jesus Christ experienced amongst us: to his name be the praise. 
   Here my brother joined with some friends from New Garden, who were going homeward; and I went next to Simons Creek monthly meeting, where I was silent during the meeting for worship. When business came on, my mind
was exercised concerning the poor slaves; but I did not feel my way clear to speak. In this condition I was bowed in spirit before the Lord; and with tears and inward supplication besought Him, so to open my understanding, that I
might know his will concerning me; and, at length, my mind was settled in silence. Near the end of their business, a member of their meeting expressed a concern, that had some time lain upon him, on account of friends so much neglecting their duty in the education of their slaves; and proposed having meetings sometimes appointed for them on a week- day, to be attended only by some friends to be named in their monthly meetings. Many present appeared to unite with the proposal. One said, he had often wondered that they, being our fellow-creatures, and capable of religious understanding, had been so exceedingly neglected : another expressed the like concern, and appeared zealous that, in future, it might be more easily considered. At length a minute was made; and the further consideration of it referred to their next monthly meeting. The friend who made this proposal hath negroes: he told me, that he was at New Garden, about two hundred and fifty miles from home, and came back alone; that in this solitary journey, this exercise, in regard to the education of their negroes, was from time to time renewed in his mind. A
friend of some note in Virginia, who hath slaves, told me, that he being far from home on a lonesome journey, had many serious thoughts about them ; and his mind was so impressed therewith, that he believed he saw a time coming, when Divine Providence would alter the circumstance of these people, respecting their condition as slaves.
   From hence I went to a meeting at Newbegun Creek, and sat a considerable time in much weakness; then I felt truth open the way to speak a little in much plainness and simplicity, till, at length, through the increase of divine love amongst us, we had a seasoning opportunity. This was also the case at the head of Little River, where we had a crowded meeting on a first day. I went thence to the Old Neck; where I was led into a careful searching out of the secret workings of the mystery of iniquity, which, under a cover of religion, exalts itself against that pure spirit, which leads in the way of meekness and self-denial. Pineywoods was the last meeting I was at in Carolina; it was large; and my heart being deeply engaged, I was drawn forth into a fervent labour amongst them.
   When I was at Newbegun Creek, a friend was there who laboured for his living, having no negroes, and who had been a minister many years. He came to me the next day; and as we rode together, he signified that he wanted to talk
with me concerning a difficulty he had been under, which he related nearly as follows. That as monies had of late years been raised by a tax to carry on the wars, he had a scruple in his mind in regard to paying it; and chose rather to suffer distraint of his goods; but as he was the only person who refused it in those parts, and knew not that any one else was in the like circumstances, he signified that it had been a heavy trial to him; especially as some of his brethren had been uneasy with his conduct in that case. He added, that from
a sympathy he felt with me yesterday in meeting, he found freedom thus to open the matter, in the way of querying concerning friends in our parts: I told him the state of friends amongst us, as well as I was able; and also that I had, for some time, been under the like scruple. I believed him to be one who was concerned to walk uprightly before the Lord; and esteemed it my duty to preserve this note concerning him, Samuel Newby.
   From hence I went back into Virginia, and had a meeting near James Cowpland's ; it was a time of inward suffering; but through, the goodness of the Lord, I was made content; at another meeting, through the renewings of pure love, we had a very comfortable season.
   Travelling up and down of late, I have had renewed evidences, that to be faithful to the Lord, and content with his will concerning me, is a most necessary and useful lesson for me to be learning; looking less at the effects of my labour, than at the pure motion and reality of the concern, as it arises
from heavenly love. In the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength; and as the mind, by humble resignation, is united to Him, and we utter words from an inward knowledge that they arise from the heavenly spring, though our way may be difficult, and it may require close attention to keep in it; and though the manner in which we may be led, may tend to our own abasement; yet, if we continue in patience and meekness, heavenly peace will be the reward of our labours. 
   I attended Curies meeting; which, though small, was reviving to the honest hearted. Afterwards I went to Black Creek and Caroline meetings; from whence, accompanied by Wm. Standley before mentioned, I rode to Goose Creek, being much through the woods, and about one hundred miles. We lodged the first night at a public-house; the second in the woods; and the next day we reached a friend's house at Goose Creek. In the woods we were under some disadvantage, having no fire-works nor bells for our horses; but we
stopped a little  before night, and let them feed on the wild grass which was plentiful; in the mean time cutting with our knives a store against night. We then secured our horses, and gathering some bushes under an oak,we lay down; but the musquetoes being numerous and the ground damp, I slept but little. Thus lying in the wilderness, and looking at the stars, I was led to contemplate on the condition of our first parents, when they were sent forth from the garden; how the Almighty, though they had been disobedient, continued to be a father to them; and showed them what tended to their felicity as intelligent creatures, and was acceptable to Him. To provide things relative to our outward living, in the way of true wisdom, is good; and the gift of improving in things useful, is a good gift, and comes from the Father of
lights. Many have had this gift; and from age to age, there have been improvements of this kind made in the world.
   But some not keeping to the pure gift, have, in the creaturely cunning and self-exaltation, sought out many inventions. As the first motive to these inventions of men, as distinct from that uprightness in which man was created, was evil, so the effects have been and are evil. It is therefore as necessary for us at this day constantly to attend on the heavenly gift, to be qualified to use rightly the good things in this life amidst great improvements, as it was for our first parents, when they were without any improvements, without any friend or father but God only.
   I was at a meeting at Goose Creek; and next at a monthly meeting at Fairfax; where, through the gracious dealing of the Almighty with us, his power prevailed over many hearts. From thence I went to Monoquacy and Pipe Creek, in Maryland; at both places I had cause humbly to adore Him, who had supported me through many exercises, and by whose help I was enabled to reach the true witness in the hearts of others. There were some hopeful young people in those parts. I had meetings afterwards at John Everiss in Monalen, and at Huntingdon; and I was made humbly thankful to the Lord, who opened my heart amongst the people in these new settlements, so that it was a time of encouragement to the honest-minded.
   At Monalen, a friend gave me some account of a religious society among the Dutch, called Mennonists; and amongst other things, related a passage in substance as follows: � One of the Mennonists having acquaintance with a man of another society at a considerable distance, and being with his wag-
gon on business near the house of his said acquaintance, and night coming on, he had thoughts of putting up with him; but passing by his fields, and observing the distressed appearance of his slaves, he kindled a fire in the woods hard by, and lay there that night. His said acquaintance hearing where he lodged and afterwards meeting the Mennonist, told him of it; adding, he should have been heartily welcome at his house; and from their acquaintance in former time, wondered at his conduct in that case. The Mennonist replied,
"ever since I lodged by thy field, I have wanted an opportunity to speak with thee. I had intended to come to thy house for entertainment; but seeing thy slaves at their work, and observing the manner of their dress, I had no liking to come to partake with thee." I then admonished him to use them with more humanity; and added, "as I lay by the fire that night, I thought that as I was a man of substance, thou wouldst have received me freely; but if I had been as poor as one of thy slaves, and had no power to help myself, I should have received from thy hand no kinder usage than they." In this journey, I was out about two months, and travelled about eleven hundred and fifty miles. I returned home under a humbling sense of the gracious dealings of the Lord with me, in preserving me through many trials and afflictions.
   A few years past, money being made current in our province for carrying on wars, and to be called on again by taxes laid on the inhabitants, my mind was often affected with the thoughts of paying such taxes; and I believe it right for me to preserve a memorandum concerning it. I was told that friends in England frequently paid taxes, when the money was applied to such purposes. I had conversation with several noted friends on the subject, who all favoured the payment of such taxes; some of them I preferred before myself, and this made me easier for a time; yet there was in the depth of my mind, a scruple which I never could get over; and, at certain times, I was greatly distressed on that account. 
   I believed that there were some upright-hearted men, who paid such taxes; yet could not see that their example was a sufficient reason for me to do so, while I believe that the spirit of truth required of me, as an individual, to suffer patiently the distress of goods, rather than pay actively.
   To refuse the active payment of a tax which our society generally paid was exceedingly disagreeable; but to do a thing contrary to my conscience, appeared yet more dreadful. When this exercise came upon me, I knew of none under the like difficulty; and in my distress, I besought the Lord to enable me to give up all, that so I might follow Him wheresoever He was pleased to lead me. Under this exercise I went to our yearly meeting at Philadelphia, in the year 1755; at which a committee was appointed of some from each quarterly meeting, to correspond with the meeting for sufferings in
London; and another to visit our monthly and quarterly meetings. After their appointment, before the last adjournment of the meeting, it was agreed that these two committees should meet together in friends' school-house in the city, to consider some things in which the cause of truth was concerned. They accordingly had a weighty conference in the fear of the Lord; at which time I perceived there were many friends under a scruple like that before-mentioned.
   As scrupling to pay a tax on account of the application, hath seldom been heard of heretofore, even amongst men of integrity, who have steadily borne their testimony against outward wars in their time; I may therefore note some things which have occurred to my mind, as I have been inwardly exercised on that account. From the steady opposition which faithful friends, in early times, made to wrong things then approved, they were hated and persecuted by men living in the spirit of this world: and suffering with firmness, they were made a blessing to the church, and the work prospered. It equally concerns men, in every age, to take heed to their own spirits; and in comparing their situation with ours, to me it appears that there was less danger of their being infected with the spirit of this world, in paying such taxes, than is the case with us now. They had little or no share in civil government; and many of them declared that they were, through the power of God, separated from the spirit in which wars were; and being afflicted by the rulers on account of their testimony, there was less likelihood of their uniting in spirit with them in things inconsistent with the purity of truth. We, from the first settlement of this land, have known little or no troubles of that sort. The profession of our predecessors was for a time accounted reproachful; but at length their uprightness being understood by the rulers, and their innocent sufferings moving them, our way of worship was tolerated; and many of our members in these colonies became active in civil government. Being thus tried with
favour and prosperity, this world appeared inviting; our minds have been turned to the improvement of our country, to merchandize and the sciences, amongst which are many things useful, if followed in pure wisdom; but in our present condition, I believe it will not be denied that a carnal mind is
gaining upon us. Some of our members, who are officers in civil government, are, in one case or other, called upon in their respective stations to assist in things relative to the wars: but being in doubt whether to act, or to crave to be excused from their office, if they see their brethren united in the payment
of a tax to carry on the said wars, may think their case not much different, and so might quench the tender movings of the Holy spirit in their minds. Thus, by small degrees, we might approach so near to fighting, that the distinction would be little else than the name of a peaceable people.
   It requires great self-denial and resignation of ourselves to God, to attain that state wherein we can freely cease from fighting when wrongfully invaded; if, by our fighting, there were a probability of overcoming the invaders. Whoever rightly attains to it, does in some degree feel that spirit, in which our Redeemer gave his life for us; and through divine goodness, many of our predecessors, and many now living, have learned this blessed lesson; but many others, having their religion chiefly by education, and not being enough acquainted with that cross which crucifies to the world, do manifest a temper distinguishable from that of an entire trust in God. In calmly considering these things, it hath not appeared strange to me, that an exercise hath now fallen upon some, which, with respect to the outward means, is different from what was known to many of those who went before us.
   Some time after the yearly meeting, the said committees met at Philadelphia; and, by adjournments; continued sitting several days. The calamities of war were now increasing; the frontier inhabitants of Pennsylvania were frequently surprised; some were slain, and many taken captive by the Indians; and while these committees sat, the corpse of one so slain was brought in a waggon, and taken through the streets of the city in his bloody garments, to alarm the people, and rouse them to war. 
   Friends thus met were not all of one mind in relation to the tax; which, to those who scrupled it, made the way more difficult. To refuse an active payment at such a time, might be construed into an act of disloyalty, and appeared likely to displease the rulers, not only here but in England; still there
was a scruple so fixed on the minds of many friends, that nothing moved it. It was a conference the most weighty that ever I was at; and the hearts of many were bowed in reverence before the Most High. Some friends of the said com-
mittees, who appeared easy to pay the tax, after several adjournments, withdrew; others of them continued till the last.
   At length, an epistle of tender love and caution to friends in Pennsylvania, was drawn up; and being read several times and corrected, was signed by such as were free to sign it, and afterward sent to the monthly and quarterly meetings.
   Ninth of eighth month, 1757. Orders came at night to the military officers in our county (Burlington), directing them to draught the militia, and prepare a number of men to go off as soldiers, to the relief of the English at Fort William
Henry, in New York government; a few days after which, there was a general review of the militia at Mount Holly, and a number of men were chosen and sent off under some officers.Shortly after, there came orders to draught three times as many, who were to hold themselves in readiness to march when fresh orders came. On the 17th there was a meeting of the military officers at Mount Holly, who agreed on a draught; orders were sent to the men so chosen, to meet their respective captains at set times and places , those in our township to meet at Mount Holly; amongst whom were a considerable number of our society. My mind being affected herewith, I had fresh opportunity to see and consider the advantage of living in the real substance of religion, where
practice doth harmonize with principle. Amongst the officers are men of understanding, who have some regard to sincerity where they see it; and when such in the execution of their office, have men to deal with whom they believe to be upright-hearted, it is a painful task to put them to trouble on account of scruples of conscience, and they will be likely to avoid it as much as easily may be. But where men profess to be so meek and heavenly-minded, and to have their trust so firmly settled in God, that they cannot join in wars; and yet, by
their spirit and conduct in common life, manifest a contrary disposition, their difficulties are great at such a time.
   When officers who are anxiously endeavouring to get troops to answer the demands of their superiors, see men, who are insincere, pretend scruple of conscience, in hopes of being excused from a,dangerous employment, it is likely they will be roughly handled. In this time of commotion some of our
young men left these parts, and tarried abroad till it was over; some came, and proposed to go as soldiers; others appeared to have a real tender scruple in their minds against joining in wars, and were much humbled under the apprehension of a trial so near. I had conversation with several of them to
my satisfaction. When the Captain came to town, some of the last mentioned went and told him in substance as follows: � That they could not bear arms for conscience sake; nor could they hire any to go in their places, being resigned as to the event. At length the Captain acquainted them all, that they might return home for the present, but he required them to provide themselves as soldiers, and be in readiness to march when called upon. This was such a time as I had not seen before; and yet I may say, with
thankfulness to the Lord, that I believed the trial was intended for our good; and I was favoured with resignation to Him. The French army having taken the fort they were besieging, destroyed it and went away; the company of, men
who were first draughted, after some days march, had orders to return home; and those on the second draught, were no more called upon on that occasion.
   Fourth, of fourth month, 1758. Orders came to some officers in Mount Holly, to prepare quarters for a short time, for about one hundred soldiers. An officer and two other men, all inhabitants of our town, came to my house. The
officer told me, that he came to desire me to provide lodging and entertainment for two soldiers, and that six shillings a week per man would be allowed as pay for it. The case being new and unexpected, I made no answer suddenly; but sat a time silent, my mind being inward. I was fully convinced, that the proceedings in wars are inconsistent with the purity of the Christian religion; and to be hired to entertain, men, who were then under pay as soldiers, was a difficulty with me. I expected they had legal authority for what they did; and after a short time I said to the officer, if the men are sent here for entertainment, I believe I shall not refuse to admit them into my house; but the nature of the case is such, that I expect I cannot keep them on hire: one of the men intimated, that he thought I might do it consistently with my religious principles. To which I made no reply; believing silence, at that time, best for me. Though they spake of two, there came only one, who tarried at any house about two weeks, and behaved himself civily. When the officer came to pay me, I told him I could not take pay, having admitted him into my house in a passive obedience to authority. I was on horseback when he spake to me; and as I turned from him, he said he was obliged to me ; to which I said nothing;
but thinking on the , expression, I grew uneasy; and afterwards, being near where he lived, I went and told him on what grounds I refused taking pay for keeping the soldier.
   I have been informed that Thomas a, Kempis lived and died in the profession of the Roman Catholic religion; and in reading his writings, I have believed him to be a man of a true Christian spirit; as fully so as many who died martyrs, because they could not join with some superstitions in that church. All true Christians are of the same spirit, but their gifts are diverse; Jesus Christ appointing to each one his peculiar office, agreeably to his infinite wisdom.
   John Huss contended against the errors which had crept into the church, in opposition to the council of Constance; which the historian reports to have consisted of some thousand persons. He modestly vindicated the cause which he believed was right; and though his language and conduct towards his judges appear to have been respectful, yet he never could be moved from the principles settled in his mind.
   At length rather than act contrary to that which he believed the Lord required of him, he chose to suffer death by fire. Thomas a Kempis, without disputing against the articles then generally agreed to, appears to have laboured, by a pious example as well as by preaching and writing, to promote virtue, and the inward spiritual religion; and I believe they were both sincere-hearted followers of Christ. True charity is an excellent virtue; and sincerely to labour for their good, whose belief in all points doth not agree with ours, is a happy state. 
   Near the beginning of the year 1758, I went one evening, in company with a friend, to visit a sick person; and before our return, we were told of a woman living near, who had for several days been disconsolate, occasioned by a dream; wherein death, and the judgments of the Almighty after death, were represented to her mind in a moving manner. Her sadness on that account, being worn off, the friend, with whom I was in company, went to see her, and had some religious conversation with her and her husband. With this visit they were somewhat affected: and the man, with many tears, expressed his satisfaction. In a short time after, the poor man, being on the river in a storm of wind, was with one more drowned. 
   Eighth month. 1758. Having had drawings in my mind to be at the quarterly meeting in Chester county, and at some meetings in the county of Philadelphia, I went first to said quarterly meeting, which was large. Several weighty matters came under consideration and debate; and the Lord was
pleased to qualify some of his servants with strength and firmness, to bear the burden of the day. Though I said but little my mind was deeply exercised; and, under a sense of God's love, in the anointing and fitting 'of some young men
for his work, I was comforted, and my heart was tendered before Him. From hence I went to the youth's meeting at Darby, where my beloved friend and brother Benjamin Jones met me, by an appointment before I left home, to
join in the visit. We were at Radnor, Merion, Richland, North Wales, Plymouth, and Abington meetings; and had cause to bow in reverence before the Lord, our gracious God, by whose help way was opened for us from day to day. I was out about two weeks, and rode about two hundred miles.
   The monthly meeting of Philadelphia having been under a concern, on account of some friends, who this summer (1758) had bought negro slaves, proposed to their quarterly meeting, to have the minute reconsidered in the yearly meeting, which was made last on that subject; and the said quarterly meeting appointed a committee to consider it, and to report to their next. This committee having met once and adjourned, and I going to Philadelphia to meet a committee of the yearly meeting, was in town the evening on which the
quarterly meeting's committee met the second time; and finding an inclination to sit with them, I, with some others, was admitted: and friends had a weighty conference on the subject. Soon after their next quarterly meeting, I heard
that the case was coming to our yearly meeting. This brought a weighty exercise upon me, and under a sense of my own infirmities, and the great danger I felt of turning aside from perfect purity, my mind was often drawn to retire alone, and put up my prayers to the Lord, that He would be graciously pleased to strengthen me; that setting aside all views of self-interest and the friendship of this world, I might stand fully resigned to his holy will.
   In this yearly meeting, several weighty matters were considered; and toward the last, that in relation to dealing with persons who purchase slaves. During the several sittings of the said meeting, my mind was frequently covered with inward prayer; and I could say with David, "that tears were my meat day and night." The case of slave-keeping lay heavy upon me; nor did I find any engagement to speak directly to any other matter before the meeting. Now when this case was opened, several faithful friends spake weightily thereto, with which I was comforted; and feeling a concern to cast in my mite, I said in substance as follows:
   "In the difficulties attending us in this life, nothing is more precious than the mind of truth inwardly manifested; and it is my earnest desire, that in this weighty matter, we may be so truly humbled as to be favoured with a clear understanding of the mind of truth, and follow it; this would be of more advantage to the society, than any medium not in the clearness of divine wisdom. The case is difficult to some who have slaves; but if such set aside all self-interest, and come to be weaned from the desire of getting estates, or even from holding them together, when truth requires the contrary, I believe way will so open that they will know how to steer through those difficulties.
   Many friends appeared to be deeply bowed under the weight of the work; and manifested much firmness in their love to the cause of truth and universal righteousness on the earth. And though none did openly justify the practice of
slave-keeping in general, yet some appeared concerned, lest the meeting should go into such measures, as might give uneasiness to many brethren; alleging, that if friends patiently continued under the exercise, the Lord, in his time, might open a way for the deliverance of these people. Finding an engagement to speak, I said, "My mind is often led to consider the purity of the Divine Being, and the justice of his judgments; and herein my soul is covered with awfulness. I cannot omit to hint of some cases, where people have not been treated with the purity of justice, and the event hath been lamentable. Many slaves on this continent are oppressed, and their cries have reached the ears of the Most High. Such are the purity and certainty of his judgments, that He cannot be partial in our favour. In infinite love and goodness, He hath opened our understandings from one time to another, concerning our duty towards this people; and it is not a time for delay. Should we now be sensible of what He requires of us, and through a respect to the private interest of some persons, or through a regard to some friendships which do not stand on an immutable foundation, neglect to do our duty in firmness and constancy, still waiting for some extraordinary means to bring about their deliverance ; God may by terrible things in righteousness answer us in this matter."
   Many faithful brethren laboured with great firmness; and the love of truth, in a good degree, prevailed. Several who had negroes, expressed their desire that a rule might be made, to deal with such friends as offenders who bought slaves in future. To this it was answered, that the root of this evil would never be effectually struck at, until a thorough search was made into the circumstances of such friends as kept negroes, with respect to the righteousness of their motives in keeping them, that impartial justice might be administered throughout. Several friends expressed their desire, that a visit
might be made to such friends as kept slaves: and many others said that they believed liberty was the negroe right; to which, at length no opposition was publicly made. A minute was made more full on that subject, than any heretofore; and the names of several friends entered, who were free to join in a
visit to such as kept slaves.  
   This day I set out for Concord; the quarterly meeting heretofore held there, was now, by reason of a great increase of members, divided into two by the
agreement of friends at our last yearly meeting. Here I met with our beloved friends Samuel Spavold and Mary Kirby from England, and with Joseph White from Bucks county; the latter had taken leave of his family in order to go on a religious visit to friends in England; and, through divine goodness, we were favoured with a strengthening opportunity together. 
   After this meeting I joined with my friends Daniel Stanton and John Scarborough in visiting friends who had slaves. At night we had a family meeting at William Trimble's, many young people being there; and it was a precious, reviving opportunity. Next morning we had a comfortable sitting
with a sick neighbour; and thence to the burial of the corpse of a friend at Uwchland meeting, at which were many people, and it was a time of divine favour; after which, we visited some who had slaves. In the evening we had a family meeting at a friend's house, where the channel of gospel love was
opened, and my mind was comforted after a hard day's labour.
   The next day we were at Goshen monthly meeting; and on the 18th attended the quarterly meeting at London Grove, it being the first held at that place. Here we met again with all the before-mentioned friends, and had some edifying meetings. Near the conclusion of the meeting for business, friends were incited to constancy in supporting the testimony of truth, and reminded of the necessity which the disciples of Christ are under, to attend principally to his business, as he is pleased to open it to us; and to be particularly careful to have our minds redeemed from the love of wealth; and our outward affairs in as little room as may be; that no temporal concerns may entangle our affections, or hinder us from diligently following the dictates of truth, in labouring to promote the pure spirit of meekness and heavenly-mindedness amongst the children of men, in these days of calamity and distress, wherein
God is visiting our land with his just judgments.
   Each of these quarterly meetings was large, and sat near eight hours. I had occasion to consider that it is a weighty thing to speak much in large meetings for business: for, except our minds are rightly prepared, and we clearly understand the case we speak to, instead of forwarding, we hinder business, and make more labour for those on whom the burden of the work is laid. If selfish views, or a partial spirit, have any room in our minds, we are unfit for the Lord's work; if we have a clear prospect of the business, and proper weight on our minds to speak, we should avoid useless apologies and repetitions. Where people are gathered from far, and adjourning a meeting of business is attended with great difficulty, it behoves all to be cautious how they detain a meeting; especially when they have sat six or seven hours, and have a great distance to ride home. After this meeting I rode home. 
   In the beginning of the 12th month, I joined in company with my friends John Sykes and Daniel Stanton in visiting such as had slaves. Some, whose hearts were rightly exercised about them, appeared to be glad of our visit; but in some places our way was more difficult. I often saw the necessity of keeping down to that root from whence our concern proceeded; and have cause, in reverent thankfulness, humbly to bow down before the Lord, who was near to me, and preserved my mind in calmness under some sharp conflicts, and begat a spirit of sympathy and tenderness in me, towards some who were grievously entangled by the spirit of this world.
