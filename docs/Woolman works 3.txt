   Having found drawings in my mind to visit friends on Long-Island, after obtaining a certificate from our monthly-meeting, I set off on the twelfth day of the fifth month, in the year 1756. When I reached the island, I lodged the first night at the house of my dear friend, Richard Hallet: the next day, being the first of the week, I was at the meeting in Newtown; in which we experienced the renewed manifestations of the love of Jesus Christ, to
the comfort of the honest-hearted. I went that night to Flushing; and the next day in company with my beloved friend, Matthew Franklin, we crossed the ferry at White Stone; were at three meetings on the main, and then returned to the island where I spent the remainder of the week in visiting meetings. The
Lord, I believe, hath a people in those parts, who ate honestly inclined to serve him; but many, I fear, are too much clogged with the things of this life, and do not come forward bearing the cross in such faithfulness as he calls for.
   My mind was deeply engaged in this visit, both in public and private; and, at several places, observing that they had Haves, I found myself under a necessity, in a friendly way, to labour with them on that subject; expressing, as way opened, the inconsistency of that practice with the purity of the Christian religion, and the ill effects of it manifested amongst us.
   The latter end of the week, their yearly-meeting began; at which were our friend, John Scarbrough, Jane Hoskins, and Susannah Brown, from Pennsylvania: the public meetings were large, and measurably favoured
with divine goodness.
   The exercise of my mind, at this meeting, was chiefly on account of those who were considered as the foremost rank in the society: and, in a meeting of ministers and elders, way opened, that I expressed in some measure what lay upon me; and, at a time when friends were met for transacting the affairs of the church, having set a while silent, I felt a weight on my mind, and stood
up; and, through the gracious regard of our heavenly Father, strength was given fully to clear myself of a burthen, which, for some days, had been increasing upon me. 
   Through the humbling dispensations of divine Providence, men are sometimes fitted for his service. The messages of the prophet Jeremiah were so disagreeable to the people, and so reverse to the spirit they lived in, that
he became the object of their reproach; and, in the weakness of nature, thought of desisting from his prophetic office. I saw at this time, that, if I was honest in declaring that which truth opened in me, I could not please all men; and laboured to be content in the way of my duty, however disagreeable to my own inclination. After this I went homeward, taking Woodbridge and Plainfield in my way; in both which meetings, the pure influence of divine love
was manifested; in an humbling sense whereof I went home; having been out about twenty-four days, and rode about three hundred and sixteen miles.
   While I was out on this journey, my heart was much affected with a sense of the state of the churches in our southern provinces; and, believing the Lord was calling me to some farther labour amongst them, I was bowed in reverence before him, with fervent desires that I might find strength to resign myself up to his heavenly will.
   Until this year, 1756, I continued to retail goods, besides following my trade as a taylor; about which time, I grew uneasy on account of my business growing too cumbersome. I had begun with selling trimmings for garments, and from thence proceeded to sell cloths and linens, and, at length, having got a considerable shop of goods, nay trade increased every year, and the road to
large business appeared open; but I felt a stop in my mind.
   Through the mercies of the Almighty, I had, in a good degree, learned to be content with a plain way of living: I had but a small family; and, on serious consideration, I believed truth did not require me to engage in much cumbering affairs: it had been my general practice to buy and fell things really useful: things that served chiefly to please the vain mind in people. I was not easy to trade in; seldom did it; and, whenever I did, I found it weaken me as a Christian.
   The increase of business became my burthen; for, though my natural inclination was toward merchandize, yet I believed truth required me to live more free from outward cumbers: and there was now a strife in my mind between the two: and in this exercise my prayers were put up to the Lord, who
graciously heard me, and gave me a heart resigned to his holy will: then I lessened my outward business; and, as I had opportunity, told my customers of my intention, that they might consider what shop to turn to: and, in a while, wholly laid down merchandize, following my trade, as a taylor, myself only, having no apprentice. I also had a nursery of apple-trees; in which I employed
some of my time in hoeing, grafting, trimming, and inoculating. In merchandize it is the custom, where I lived, to sell chiefly on credit, and most people often get in debt; and when payment is expected, not having
wherewith to pay, their creditors often sue for it at law. Having often observed occurrences of this kind, I found it good for me to advise poor people to take such goods as were most useful and not costly.
   In the time of trading, I had an opportunity of seeing, that the too liberal use of spirituous liquors, and the custom of wearing too costly apparel, led some people into great inconveniences; and these two things appear to be often connected; for, by not attending to that use of things which is consistent
with universal righteousness, there is an increase of labour which extends beyond what our heavenly Father intends for us: and by great labour, and often by much sweating, there is, even among such as are not drunkards, a craving of some liquors to revive the spirits: that, partly by the luxurious drinking of some, and partly by the drinking of others, (led to it through immoderate labour,) very great quantities of rum are every year expended in our colonies; the greater part of which we should have no need of, did we steadily attend to pure wisdom.
   Where men take pleasure in feeling their minds elevated with strong drink, and so indulge their appetite as to disorder their understandings, neglect their duty as members in a family or civil society, and cast off all regard to religion, their case is much to be pitied; and where such, whose lives are for the most  past regular, and whose examples have a strong influence on the minds of
others, adhere to some customs which powerfully draw to the use of more strong liquor than pure wisdom allows; this also, as it hinders the spreading of the spirit of meekness, and strengthens the hands of the more excessive drinkers, is a case to be lamented.
   Every degree of luxury hath some connexion with evil, those who profess to be disciples of Christ, and are looked upon as leaders of the people, should have that mind in them which was also in Christ, and so stand separate from every wrong way, as a means of help to the weaker. As I have sometimes been much spent in the heat, and taken spirits to revive me, I have found, by experience, that in such circumstances the mind is not so calm, nor so fitly disposed for divine meditation, as when all such extremes are avoided; and I have felt an increasing care to attend to that holy Spirit which sets bounds to our desires, and leads those, who faithfully follow it, to apply all the gifts of
divine Providence to the purposes for which they were intended. Did such, as have the care of great estates, attend with singleness of heart to this heavenly Instructor, which so opens and enlarges the mind, that men love their neighbours as themselves, they would have wisdom given them to manage
without finding occasion to employ some people in the luxuries of life, or to make it necessary for others to labour too hard; but, for want of steadily regarding this principle of divine love, a selfish spirit takes place in the
minds of people, which is attended with darkness and manifold confusion in the world.
   Though trading in things useful is an honest employ; yet, through the great number of superfluities which are bought and sold, and through the corruption of the times, they, who apply to merchandize for a living, have great need to be well experienced in that precept which the prophet Jeremiah laid down for his bribe: "Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not." In the winter this year, I was engaged with friends in visiting families; and through the goodness of the Lord, we often times experienced his heart-tendering presence amongst us.
   Being in good health, and abroad with friends visiting families, I lodged at a friend's house in Burlington. Going to bed about the time usual with me, I awoke in the night, and my meditations, as I lay, were on the goodness and mercy of the 'Lord; in a sense whereof my heart was contrited. After this I went to sleep again; in a short time I awoke, it was yet dark, and no appearance of day or moonshine; and as I opened mine eyes, I saw a light
in my chamber, at the apparent distance of five feet, about nine inches diameter, of a clear easy brightness, and near its centre the most radiant. As I lay still looking upon Hi: without any surprise, words were spoken to my inward ear, which filled my whole inward man. They were not the effect of thought, nor any conclusion in relation to the appearance; but as the language of the Holy One, spoken in my mind. The words were, Certain Evidence or Divine Truth. They were again repeated exactly in the same manner, and then the light disappeared.
   Feeling the exercise in relation to a visit to the Southern Provinces to increase upon me, I acquainted our monthly g therewith, and obtained their certificate. Expecting go alone, one of my brothers who lived in Philadelphia,
having some business in North Carolina, proposed going with part of the way; but as he had a view of some outward affairs, to accept of him as a companion was some difficulty with me, whereupon I had conversation with him at sundry times. At length feeling easy in my mind, I had conversation with several elderly friends of Philadelphia on the subject; and he obtaining a certificate suitable to the occasion, we set off in the fifth month, 1757. Coming to Nottingham week-day meeting, we lodged at John Churchman's, where I
met with our friend Benjamin Buffington, from New England, who was returning from a visit to the Southern Provinces. Thence we crossed the river Susquehannah, and lodged at William Cox's in Maryland.
   Soon after I entered this province, a deep and painful exercise came upon me, which I often had some feeling of, since my mind was drawn toward these parts, and with which I had acquainted my brother before we agreed to join as companions. As the people in this and the Southern Provinces live much on
the labour of slaves, many of whom are used hardly, my concern was that I might attend with singleness of heart to the voice of the true Shepherd, and be so supported as to remain unmoved at the faces of men.
   As it is common for friends on such a visit to have entertainment free of cost, a difficulty arose in my mind with respect to saving my money by kindness received, from what appeared to me to be the gain of oppression. Receiving a gift, considered as a gift, brings the receiver under obligations to the benefactor, and has a natural tendency to draw the obliged into a party with the giver. To prevent difficulties of this kind, and to preserve the minds of judges from any bias, was that divine prohibition.  As the disciples were sent forth without any provision for their journey, and our Lord said the workman is worthy of his meat, their labour in the gospel was considered as a reward for their entertainment, and therefore not received as a gift; yet, in regard to my
present journey, I could not see my way clear in that respect. The difference appeared thus: the entertainment the disciples met with, was from them whose hearts God had opened to receive them, from a love to them and the truth they published; but we considered as members of the same religious society, look upon it as a piece of civility to receive each other in such visits; and such reception, at times, is partly in regard to reputation, and not from an inward unity of heart and spirit. Conduct is more convincing than language; and where people, by their actions, manifest that the slave-trade is not so disagreeable to their principles but that it may be encouraged, there is not a sound uniting with some friends who visit them.
   The prospect of so weighty a work, and of being so distinguished from many whom I esteemed before myself, brought me very low; and such were the conflicts of my soul, that I had a near sympathy with the prophet, in the time
of his weakness, when he said, "If thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thy sight." But I soon saw that this proceeded from the want of a full resignation to the divine will. Many were the afflictions which attended me; and in great abasement, with many tears, my cries were to the Almighty for his gracious and fatherly assistance; and after a time of deep trial, I was favoured to understand the state mentioned by the psalmist, more clearly than ever I had done before; to wit; "My soul is even as a weaned child." Being thus helped to sink down into resignation, I felt a deliverance
from that tempest in which I had been sorely exercised, and in calmness of mind went forward, trusting that the Lord Jesus Christ, as I faithfully attended to him, would be a counsellor to me in all difficulties; and that by his strength I should be enabled, even to leave money with the members of society where I had entertainment, when I found that omitting it, would obstruct that work to which I believed he had called me. As I copy this after my return, I may here
add, that oftentimes I did so, under a sense of duty. The way in which I did it was thus ; when I expected soon to leave a friend's house where I had entertainment, if I believed that I should not keep clear from the gain of oppression without leaving money, I spoke to one of the heads of the family
privately, and desired them to accept of those pieces of silver, and give them to such of their negroes as they believed would make the best use of them: and at other times, I gave them to the negroes myself, as the way looked clearest to me. Before I came out, I had provided a large number of small pieces for this purpose ; and thus offering them to some who appeared to be wealthy people, was a trial both to me and them. But the fear of the Lord so covered me at times, that my way was made easier than I expected; and few, if any,
manifested any resentment at the offer, and most of them, after some conversation, accepted of them.
   A friend at whose house we breakfasted setting us a little on our way, I had conversation with him, in the fear of the Lord, concerning his slaves; in which
my heart was tender; I used much plainness of speech with him, and he appeared to take it kindly. We pursued our journey without appointing meetings, being pressed in my mind to be at the yearly meeting in Virginia. In my travelling on the road, I often felt a cry rise from the centre of my mind, thus; "O Lord, I am a stranger on the earth, hide not thy face from me." On the eleventh, we crossed the rivers Patowmack and Rapahannock, and lodged at Port Royal. On the way we had the company of a colonel of the militia, who appeared to be a thoughtful man. I took occasion to remark on the difference in general betwixt a people used to labour moderately for their living, training up their children in frugality and business, and those who live on the labour of slaves; the former, in my view, being the most happy life. He concurred in the remark, and mentioned the trouble arising from the untoward, slothful disposition of the negroes; adding, that one of our labourers would do as
much in a day as two of their slaves. I replied, that free men, whose minds were properly on their business, found a satisfaction in improving, cultivating, and providing for their families; but negroes, labouring to support others who claim them as their property, and expecting nothing but slavery during life, had not the like inducement to be industrious. 
   After some further conversation I said, that men having power, too often misapplied it; that though we made slaves of the negroes, and the Turks made slaves of the Christians, I believed that liberty was the natural right of all men equally.  This he did not deny; but said, the lives of the negroes were so wretched in their own country, that many of them lived better here than there. I replied, there is great odds in regard to us, on what principle we act; and so the conversation on that subject ended. I may here add, that another person, some time afterwards, mentioned the wretchedness of the negroes, occasioned by their intestine wars, as an argument in favour of our fetching them away for slaves. To which I replied, if compassion for the Africans, on account of their domestic troubles, was the real motive of our purchasing them, that spirit of tenderness being attended to, would incite us to use them kindly; that as strangers brought out of affliction, their lives might be happy among us. And
as they are human creatures, whose souls are as precious as ours, and who may receive the same help and comfort from the holy scriptures as we do, we could not omit suitable endeavours to instruct them therein; but that while we manifest by our conduct, that our views in purchasing them are to advance ourselves; and while our buying captives taken in war, animates those parties to push on the war, and increase desolation amongst them; to say they live unhappy in Africa, is far from being an argument in our favour. I further said, the present circumstances of these provinces to me appear difficult; the slaves look like a burdensome stone to such as burden themselves with them; and that if the white people retain a resolution to prefer their outward prospects, of gain to all other considerations, and do not act conscientiously toward them as fellow-creatures, I believe that burden will grow heavier and heavier, until times change in a way disagreeable to us. The person appeared very serious; and owned, that in considering their condition, and the manner of their treatment in these provinces, he had some times thought it might be just in the Almighty so to order it.
   Having travelled through Maryland, we came amongst friends at Cedar Creek in Virginia, on the twelfth; and the next day rode, in company with several friends, a day's jour ney to Camp Creek. As I was riding along in the morning, my mind was deeply affected in a sense I had of the want of divine aid to support me, in the various difficulties which attended me; and in uncommon distress of mind, I cried in secret to the Most High, "O Lord be merciful, I beseech thee, to thy poor afflicted creature.� After some time, I 
felt inward relief; and soon after, a friend in company began to talk in support of the slave-trade, and said, the negroes were understood to be the offspring of Cain, their blackness being the mark which God set upon him, after he murdered Abel his brother; that it was the design of Providence they should be slaves, as a condition proper to the race of so wicked a man as Cain was. Then another spake in support of what had been said. To all which I replied in sub-
stance as follows; that Noah and his family were all who survived the flood, according to scripture; and as Noah was of Seth's race, the family of Cain was wholly destroyed. One of them said, that after the flood Ham went to the Land of Nod and took a wife; that Nod was a land far distant, inhabited by Cain's race, and that the flood did not reach it; and as Ham was sentenced to be a servant of servants to his brethren, these two families being thus joined, were undoubtedly fit only for slaves. I replied, the flood was a judgment upon the world for their abominations; and it was granted that Cain's stock was the most wicked, and therefore unreasonable to suppose that they were spared. As to Ham's going to the land of Nod for a wife, no time being fixed, Nod might be inhabited by some of Noah's family, before Ham married a second time; moreover the text saith, "That all flesh died that moved upon the earth."  I further reminded them how the prophets repeatedly declare, "that the son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father: but every one be answerable for his own sins." I was troubled to perceive the darkness of their imaginations;
and in some pressure of spirit said, the love of ease and gain are the motives in general of keeping slaves, and men are wont to take hold of weak arguments to support a cause which is unreasonable. I have no interest on either side, save only the interest which I desire to have in the truth. I believe liberty is their right, and as I see they are not only deprived of it, but treated in other respects with inhumanity in many places, I believe He, who is a refuge for the oppressed, will, in his own time, plead their cause; and happy will it be for such as walk in uprightness before Him. And thus our conversation ended.
   I was this day at Camp Creek monthly-meeting, and then rode to the mountains up James� River, and had a meeting at a friend's house; in both which I felt sorrow of heart, and my tears were poured out before the Lord, who was pleased to afford a degree of strength, by which way was opened to clear my mind amongst friends in those places. From thence I went to Fork Creek, and so to Cedar Creek again; at which place I now1 had a meeting.
Here I found a tender seed; and as I was preserved in the ministry to keep low with the Truth, the same truth in their hearts answered it; that it was a time of mutual refreshment from the presence of the Lord. I lodged at James Standley's, father of William Standley, one of the young men who suffered imprisonment at Winchester last summer, on account of their testimony against fighting; and I had some satisfactory conversation with him concerning it. Hence I went to the Swamp-meeting, and to Wayanoke-meeting; and then crossed James' River, and lodged near Burleigh. From the time of my entering Maryland I have been much under sorrow, which of late so increased upon me, that my mind was almost overwhelmed; and I may say with the psalmist, "In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God;" who, in infinite goodness, looked upon my affliction, and in my
private retirement sent the Comforter for my relief; for which I humbly bless his holy name.
    The sense I had of the state of the churches, brought a weight of distress upon me. The gold to me appeared dim, and the fine gold changed; and though this is the case too generally, yet the sense of it in these parts hath in a particular manner, borne heavy upon me. It appeared to me, that through the prevailing of the spirit of this world, the minds of many were brought to an inward desolation; and instead of the spirit of meekness, gentleness, and heavenly wisdom, which are the necessary companions of the true sheep of
Christ, a spirit of fierceness, and the love of dominion, too generally prevailed. From small beginnings in error, great buildings, by degrees, are raised; and from one age to another are more and more strengthened by the general concurrence of the people; and as men obtain reputation by their profession of the truth, their virtues are mentioned as arguments in favour of general error; and. those of less note, to justify themselves, say, such and such good men
did the like. 
   The prospect of a way being open to the same degeneracy, in some parts of this newly settled land of America, in respect to our conduct towards the negroes, hath deeply bowed my mind in this journey; and though briefly to relate how these people are treated is no agreeable work; yet, after often
reading over the notes I made as I travelled, I find my mind engaged to preserve them. Many of the white people in those provinces take little or no care of negro marriages; and when negroes marry after their own way, some make so little account of those marriages, that with views of outward interest, they often part men from their wives by selling them far asunder; which is common when estates are sold by executors at vendue. Many whose labour is heavy, being followed at their business in the field, by a man with a whip, hired for that purpose, have in common little else allowed but one peck of Indian corn and some salt, for one week, with a few potatoes; the potatoes they commonly raise by their labour on the first day of the week. The correction ensuing on their disobedience to overseers, or slothfulncss in business, is often very severe, and sometimes desperate.
   Men and women have many times scarcely clothes sufficient to hide their nakedness, and boys and girls, ten and twelve years old, are often quite naked amongst their master's children. Some of our society, and some of the society
called new-lights, use some endeavours to instruct those they have in reading; but in common this is not only neglected, but disapproved. These are the people by whose labour the other inhabitants are in a great measure supported, and many of them in the luxuries of life. These are the people who
have made no agreement to serve us, and who have not forfeited their liberty that we know of. These are the souls for whom Christ died; and for our conduct towards them, we must answer before Him who is no respecter of persons. They who know the only, true God, and Jesus Christ whom He
hath sent, and are thus acquainted with the merciful, benevolent, gospel spirit, will therein perceive that the indignation of God is kindled against oppression and cruelty; and in beholding the great distress of so numerous a people, will find cause for mourning.
   From my lodgings I went to Burleigh-meeting; where I felt my mind drawn into a quiet resigned state. After long silence, I felt an engagement to stand up; and through the powerful operation of divine love, we were favoured with an 
edifying meeting. The next meeting we had was at Black-Water; and from thence went to the yearly-meeting at the Western Branch. When business began, some queries were introduced by some of their members for consideration; and if approved, they were to be answered hereafter by their
respective monthly-meetings. They were the Pennsylvania queries, which had been examined by a committee of Virginia yearly meeting appointed the last year, who made some alterations in them; one of which alterations was made in favour of a custom which troubled me. The query was, "Are there any concerned in the importation of negroes, or in buying them after imported?� which was thus altered.
"Are there any concerned in the importation of negroes, or buying them to trade in?" As one query admitted with unanimity was, "Are any concerned in buying or vending goods unlawfully imported, or prize goods?'' I found my mind engaged to say, that as we profess the truth, and were there assembled to support the testimony of it, it was necessary for us to dwell deep, and act in that wisdom which is pure; or otherwise we could not prosper. I then mentioned their alteration; and referring to the last mentioned query, added,
that as purchasing any merchandize taken by the sword, was always allowed to be inconsistent with our principles; so negroes being captives of war, or taken by stealth, it was inconsistent with our testimony to buy them ; and their being our fellow-creatures, and sold as slaves, added greatly to the iniquity. Friends appeared attentive to what was said; some expressed a care and concern about their negroes; none made any objection, by way of reply to what I said; but the query was admitted as they had altered it.
   As some of their members have heretofore traded in negroes, as in other merchandize, this query being admitted, will be one step further than they have hitherto gone; and I did not see it my duty to press for an alteration: but felt easy to leave it all to Him, who alone is able to turn the hearts of the mighty, and make way for the spreading of truth on, the earth, by means agreeable to his infinite wisdom. In regard to those they already had, I felt my mind engaged to labour with them; and said, that, as we believe the scriptures
were given forth by holy men, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and many of us know by experience that they are often helpful and comfortable, and believe ourselves bound in duty to teach our children to read them; I believed that if we were divested of all selfish views, the same good spirit that gave them forth, would engage us' to teach the negroes to read, that they might have the benefit of them. Some present manifested a concern to take more care in the education of their negroes. Twenty-ninth fifth month. At the house where I lodged was a meeting of ministers and elders. I found an engagement to speak freely and plainly to them concerning their slaves; mentioning how they, as the first rank in the society, whose conduct in that case was much noticed by others, were under the stronger obligations to look carefully to themselves. Expressing how needful it was for them in that situation, to be thoroughly divested of all selfish views ; that living in the pure
truth, and acting conscientiously towards those people in their education and otherwise, they might be instrumental in helping forward a work so exceedingly necessary, and so much neglected amongst them. At the twelfth hour the meeting of worship began, which was a solid meeting.
