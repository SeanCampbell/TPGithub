LETTER III
March 24, 1774
AT the same time that I hold that �Parliament hath not the Rights of Sovereignty over his Majesty�s American Subjects, and that these rights reside
in themselves," I do not mean to promote an ungrateful forsaking of the mother country by her children, to sever and estrange the sons from the fathers; but where filial duty and obedience ceases to substitute in its stead a brotherly affection, a manly and independent friendship, - which naturally takes place where the parent hath truly loved and exercised his authority for the sole end of promoting the welfare of the child, without a view to self-
interest, or the gratification of pride, ambition, or other vicious passion. I would consider the American governments, like that of Ireland, as sister kingdoms; and I would cement a lasting union with them as between the
separate branches of one great family. We know that it is impossible to effect such a family union, if the arrogance of the elder branch expect to govern the others, or even demand their homage; and how much more so, if it demand the use of their purses at its own discretion, as a return for former assistance, or under pretence of maintaining the honour and interest of the whole combined family. But while every one is left independent, and no other influence is made use of but that of sincere brotherly affection, a reciprocation of good offices, and a fair representation of the general advantage of the
whole, there is little doubt but that all will be ready to contribute their respective shares, 2nd that due respect and deference will ever be paid to the elder house. Family pride, no less than those advantages which result from unions of such a nature, will produce this effect,  except we be ashamed of our family. I hope a selfish and tyrannical spirit in the English, will not make the Americans ashamed of their descent: but illustration is misleading us again into the tempting, but unsure, path of analogy. Let us quit it once more before we lose fight of the direct road.
   Every one of those writers, who endeavour to support the pretensions of parliament to the sovereignty of America by any shew of abstract reasoning, have, so far as they have fallen under my observation, either fat out upon
defective premises, or from good ones, have drawn false conclusions; as needs must be in this cafe, until truth become a changeling. Plain sense, and an ingenuous mind, are sufficient to guard any one against their sophistry: but we have need of a little more penetration, and to be somewhat conversant in affairs, when we would dispute with a different sort, who plunge headlong into the depths of politics, and hurry us unprepared into all the intricacies of commerce; placing at once before our eyes, in an indirect point of view, that multiplicity of wheels within wheels, pulleys upon pulleys, and springs upon
springs, which belong to the complicated machines of government and trade, instead of directing our attention to the first principles of motion, and the few master springs, on whose movements all the rest depend in a regular order and subordination. By these means they endeavour to confound, when they cannot convince us. But these are dishonest arts, the common tricks of designing men in every sphere. They are too stale and hackneyed, however, to impose upon men of sound and cultivated understandings. These know, that government and trade, as well as every science whatever, are established on a very small number of fundamental principles of the utmost simplicity, since they must be self-evident, or they are no principles at all; and they know also, that those who mean honestly, do always ultimately refer every maxim, by clear inferences, to some one or other of these simple, self-evident principles. All the subtleties and refinements, all the arguments that the wit of man can
invent, will never be sufficient to justify any species of arbitrary dominion, while we retain a knowledge of this short and simple propositions "the good of society is the end of civil government;" nor will they ever justify a discretionary taxation by a prince or government, the people being unrepresented, so long as we know, that "a man hath no property in that which another can by right take from him without his consent." 
   One of the most specious arguments made use of in support of a sovereign power in parliament over the Americans, is that drawn from a supposed necessity of equipping a powerful armament at a short notice, for the protection of the whole empire, as these gentlemen will have it: hereupon we are asked, if his Majesty is to have imposed upon him the arduous task of first obtaining a majority in two Houses of Commons in Europe, and about thirty
provincial assemblies in America, before he can raise the necessary supplies? and the interrogators seem to plume themselves much upon the impossibility of carrying-on the executive part of government under such restraints. Let
me, in return, ask how we draw supplies from Ireland? Are they voted in the British House of Commons? Then, in the first place, I answer, that if an empire be too large, and its parts too widely separated by immense oceans, of
other impediments, to admit of being governed on the principles essentially belonging to all free governments, it is an over-grown empire, and ought to be divided before it fall to pieces. The welfare and happiness of mankind supercede every other possible claim or pretension to governs. When we find ourselves subject to a distant power, which cannot possibly govern us on any other principles than those of tyranny, we have an inherent right, by the law of nature, and it is an indispensable duty to ourselves, and to our posterity, to shake off such an unjust yoke, and to erect a free government amongst
ourselves. Those degenerate Englishmen, who are now seeking to enslave the Americans, would ill brook the government of the Emperor of Germany, if by any means he should lawfully inherit the crown of these kingdoms, and make Vienna the seat of government. Would they suffer themselves to be taxed by German ministers, or German diets? Would they not say to their sovereign,
�either come and reside amongst us, or delegate to your vice-roy all the prerogatives of the crown, and leave us, in conjunction with him alone to tax and to govern ourselves according to our own just laws, and the rights of a free people?�  Can any language be plainer? Can any doctrine be more intelligible or more equitable? But, in answer to the above interrogatory, I have another answer as intelligible as this.
   Establish the mode of governing which these persons contend for, and there will still be the same inevitable delay, with regard to the American supplies, as they would have us believe is peculiar to the mode which the people there claim a right to exercise. For tho' a British parliament might vote them with their usual alacrity, yet we must send to America to collect them. And if our
armament cannot go on without first sending so far for this collection, its operations may as well be suspended a few days or a few weeks longer, in order to obtain it on British, rather than on Prussian principles. But the truth is, we should not defer the equipment of any necessary armament one moment on this account. Do we at present wait for the assembling of parliament, and a vote of supplies, before we arm in any just cause in which the safety, the interest or honour of the state is concerns!? Doth not the executive branch of government, by virtue of its own powers, and in discharge of its duty, put the state in a posture of defence upon every alarm without loss of time, and then apply to parliament for its approbration and support? Is it ever with-held in a just cause? Hath the government no resources, no ways
and means of its own, for discharging, or contracting for the future discharge of, these prompt expences of the state? If the uncertainty of meeting with like support from America, as they find in Great Britain, should be a clog upon our. ministers in their warlike projects, might it not be fortunate for the people of both countries? Would it not make them extremely cautious and prudent how they involved us in continental politics and in German wars? No ingenuous man will, however, entertain a serious doubt of the readiness of the Americans to contribute their share to every necessary expence of government, so long as they shall find themselves in possession of their freedom. They must contribute their share; that is to say, they must preserve their own existence as a people, and defend their own property, under any form of government whatever. When men tell us, that an enlightened and free
people are refractory; that they will not contribute their proportion of taxes; that at the hazard of their lives by the sword or the halter, they oppose and seek to subvert the government, and this for a succession of years; they tell us, with a moral certainty, though perhaps without meaning it, that they feel some real Oppressions, some real invasions made on their rights or liberties; for no
other causes ever did, or ever will, produce a general and permanent opposition in the whole body of a people towards their governors. When we remark likewise, that, in the present contest, there is no religious zeal of persecution; no national antipathy or rancour, but quite the reverse; no introduction of a new code of laws by a foreign conqueror; no imaginary pretender to weaken the allegiance of the people towards their sovereign; nor indeed any one cause of dissatisfaction, but the avowed one; and that, on the part of the peoples clearly justified on the obvious principles of the English constitution, can we hesitate a moment to pronounce what ought to be done? We ought to allow the Americans to tax themselves as an inseparable adjunct to freedom.
